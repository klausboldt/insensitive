TOCSY

<p>
In a <a href="cosyqf.html">COSY</a> spectrum where two <a href="chemical_shift.html">chemical shifts</a> 
cannot be resolved the assignment of two separate spin systems which are not <a href="coupling.html">
<i>J</i>-coupled</a> to each other becomes difficult. Good examples for this kind of systems are peptides 
and glycosides where the coupling information is not transferred between monomer units. The TOCSY 
spectrum shows cross peaks between all spins in a spin network and can be used in these cases to assign 
complete spin networks.

<p>
The <a href="pulse_sequences.html">pulse sequence</a> is comparable to the COSY sequence, but instead of 
the second 90&deg;-pulse a <a href="spin_lock.html">spin lock</a> sequence is applied. During this phase 
the spins are held constant in the <a href="rotating_frame.html">rotating frame</a> and the chemical 
shifts are suppressed. If the Hartmann-Hahn condition is fulfilled and all spins experience the same 
<b>B</b><sub>1</sub>-field the spins are strongly coupled during the spin lock sequence. The then possible
flip-flop exchange between the <i>&alpha;&beta;</i> and <i>&beta;&alpha;</i> levels causes the 
magnetisation to flow between all coupled spins.
</p>
<p>
To fulfil the Hartmann-Hahn condition in the homonuclear TOCSY experiment one needs to apply the same 
field strength to all coupled spins. This puts high demands on the spectrometer hardware: The wider the 
spectral range of the pulse should be the higher the pulse power needs to be. A long high power 
irradiation can heat up the sample and destroy the electronics in the sample head.
<br><br>
Usually pulse sequences instead of continuous wave irradiation are used for the TOCSY experiment. The 
simplest one is a sequence of closely separated 180&deg;<sub>y</sub>-pulses. The time between pulses 
should be short to not allow <a href="precession.html">precession</a> while the total length of the 
spin lock sequence should be long compared to 1/<i>J</i>.
</p>
<p>
A more sophisticated sequence is the MLEV-17 sequence, which is constructed from blocks of 
90&deg;<sub>x</sub>-180&deg;<sub>y</sub>-90&deg;<sub>x</sub> pulses (R) and the inverted sequence 
90&deg;<sub>-x</sub>-180&deg;<sub>-y</sub>-90&deg;<sub>-x</sub> (r) in a supercycle RRrr rRRr rrRR RrrR. 
The sequence is ended with a 60&deg;<sub>x</sub>-pulse to invert possible phase errors and repeated to 
ensure a coherence transfer over the whole spin system.
</p>
<p>
The effects of the spin lock in the TOCSY experiment is best understood by setting up a linear spin system of 
three I spins with large differences in chemical shifts and different coupling constants. Disable dipolar 
relaxation to suppress effects from the <href="roesyph.html">ROESY</a> experiment. Apply the 90&deg; pulse to 
only the first spin. The spin lock is applied by enabling I spin decoupling. Perform the sequence first without
and then with strong coupling. Only in the latter case will the magnetisation be transferred to the other 
spins.
