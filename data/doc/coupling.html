<i>J</i>-Coupling
</h1>
</div>

<div>
<p>
Different spins in a molecule do not <a href="precession.html">precess</a> independently. If one spin can 
have different energy states depending on which state a nearby spin is in these to spins are coupled.
There are two basic mechanisms by which information between coupled spins is exchanged: <i>J</i>-coupling 
and <a href="dipolar_coupling.html">dipolar coupling</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <i>J</i>-coupling is an interaction through chemical bonds that dominates the coupling terms in 
isotropic liquids: In a magnetic field a nuclear spin is oriented in one possible eigenstate. An electron 
nearby tends to be antiparallel to the nuclear spin, owing to the Fermi interaction between the two 
particles. The bond's second electron must be of opposite spin following Pauli's exclusion principle. 
The second electron defines the preferred orientation of the bound nucleus and gives rise to a small excess
of antiparallel oriented nuclear spins that are directly bound. Coupling over more bonds can be explained
by Hund's rule which states that electron spins close to a nucleus tend to be ordered in parallel. The 
information is thus transported over to the next bond.
Since only s-electrons have finite probability to be near the nucleus the <i>J</i>-coupling increases with
increasing s-character of the chemical bond.

The coupling between two spins is given by the 3 x 3 real coupling tensor <b>J</b> in units of Hertz that 
depends on the molecular orientation to the external magnetic field.

The spin Hamiltonian for the coupling is then written as

<p>
In isotropic liquids the tensor averages to the scalar coupling constant <i>J</i> that is equal to the 
average of the tensor's diagonal elements. One distinguishes between two cases:
</p>
<p>
The weak coupling regime applies to all heteronuclear couplings as well as homonuclear couplings if the 
difference in <a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequencies</a> is much larger than the coupling. 
</p>
<center><img src="formula_weak_coupling.png" height="21" width="142"></center>
<p>
In this case the coupling depends only on the component of the magnetisation along the external field. 
</p>
<center><img src="formula_coupling_weak.png" height="22" width="136"></center>
<p>
The product operator that represents scalar coupling in the weak coupling case is the 
<a href="longitudinal_two_spin_order.html">longitudinal two-spin order</a> <op>2&pi;<i>J</i> I1zI2z</op>.
</p>
<p>
The strong coupling between homonuclear spins with small frequency separation depends on all spatial
components of the magnetisation vector. In this case the two states |<i>&alpha;&beta;</i>> and 
|<i>&beta;&alpha;</i>> are close enough in energy that a flip-flop exchange between the two
<a href="energy_levels.html">energy levels</a> can happen.
</p>
<center><img src="formula_coupling_strong.png" height="22" width="146"></center>
<p>
Strong coupling leads to a distortion of the peak amplitude with the spectral lines of the spin pair that 
are closer to each other becoming stronger while the ones further apart become weaker ('roofing' effect).

<p>
Scalar coupling transforms in-phase <a href="coherences.html">coherences</a> into 
<a href="antiphase_magnetization.html">antiphase magnetisation</a> and back into in-phase magnetisation during 
periods of free evolution.
</p>

<p>
The coupling of spin 1 (red vectors) to spin two (blue vectors) leads to two distinct resonance frequencies, 
<i>&Omega;</i><sup>0</sup> + 0.5 <i>J</i> and <i>&Omega;</i><sup>0</sup> - 0.5 <i>J</i>, depending on whether 
the coupled spin is in the <i>&alpha;</i>- or <i>&beta;</i>-state.
