<p><a href="cosyqf.html"><b>COSY</b></a></p>
<p>The COrrelated SpectroscopY that shows <i>J</I>-coupling as cross peaks was the first two-dimensional NMR experiment. (Bruker code: cosyqf)</p>
<p><a href="apt.html"><b>APT</b></a></p>
<p>The APT (Attached Proton Test) experiment was designed to show the number of attached protons to carbon atoms while decoupling is used. (Bruker code: jmod and apt)</p>
<p><a href="dept.html"><b>DEPT</b></a></p>
<p>The DEPT (Distortionless Enhancement by Polarisation Transfer) experiment was designed to improve the sensitivity of NMR experiments on low-abundant and low magnetogyric ratio nuclei. (Bruker code: dept)</p>
<p><a href="stegp1f.html"><b>DOSY</b></a></p>
<p>The Diffusion Ordered Spectroscopy allows to measure diffusion constants and hydrodynamic radii in an mixture of compounds. (Bruker code: stegp1s)</p>
<p><a href="dqf_cosy.html"><b>DQF-COSY</b></a></p>
<p>The Double Quantum Filtered COSY causes narrower spectral lines than the COSY experiment on the costs of signal strength. (Bruker code: cosydfqf)</p>
<p><a href="ecos3ph.html"><b>E.COSY</b></a></p>
<p>The exclusive COSY or E.COSY is a difference spectrum of a double and a triple quantum filtered COSY spectrum, which helps to resolve small coupling constants. (Bruker code: ecos2nph and ecos3cph)</p>
<p><a href="hxcoqf.html"><b>HETCOR</b></a></p>
<p>The 2D Heteronuclear Chemical-Shift Correlation (HETCOR) experiment is the heteronuclear analogue to the COSY experiment. Due to detection on the X-heteronuclei the HMQC and HSQC experiments are preferred in routine measurements. (Bruker code: hxcoqf)</p>
<p><a href="hmbclpndqf.html"><b>HMBC</b></a></p>
<p>The 2D HMBC (heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation) experiment permits to obtain a 2D heteronuclear Chemical Shift correlation map between long-range coupled 1H and heteronuclei. (Bruker code: hmbclpndqf)</p>
<p><a href="hmqcqf.html"><b>HMQC</b></a></p>
<p>The 2D HMQC (heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation) permits to obtain a 2D heteronuclear chemical shift correlation map between directly-bound 1H and X-heteronuclei via <a href="multi_quantum_coherence.html">multi-quantum coherences</a>. (Bruker code: hmqcqf)</p>
<p><a href="hsqcph.html"><b>HSQC</b></a></p>
<p>The 2D HMQC (heteronuclear single-quantum correlation) permits to obtain a 2D heteronuclear chemical shift correlation map between directly-bound 1H and X-heteronuclei via <a href="single_quantum_coherence.html">single-quantum coherences</a>. (Bruker code: hsqcph)</p>
<p><a href="inad1d.html"><b>INADEQUATE</b></a></p>
<p>The INADEQUATE (Incredible Natural Abundance Double Quantum Transfer Experiment) experiment permits to obtain information derived from <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>13</sup>C couplings and can be used to establish the identity of adjacent carbon atoms in a molecule. In addition, from INADEQUATE spectra, direct and long-range <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>13</sup>C coupling constants can be measured. (Bruker code: inad1d)</p>
<p><a href="ineptnd.html"><b>INEPT</b></a></p>
<p>The INEPT (Insensitive Nuclei Enhancement by Polarisation Transfer) experiment was designed to improve the sensitivity of NMR experiments on low-abundant and low magnetogyric ratio nuclei. (Bruker code: ineptnd and ineptrd)</p>
<p><a href="t1ir1d.html"><b>Inversion-Recovery</b></a></p>
<p>The inversion-recovery experiment allows to measure longitudinal or spin-lattice T<sub>1</sub> relaxation times. (Bruker code: t1ir1d)</p>
<p><a href="j_resolved.html"><b><i>J</i>-Resolved</b></a></p>
<p>The 2D <i>J</i>-Resolved spectroscopy is used to simplify a spectrum by separating chemical shift and coupling information into two dimensions. (Bruker code: jresqf)</p>
<p><a href="noesyph.html"><b>NOESY</b></a></p>
<p>The 2D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser SpectroscopY) experiment offers a simple way to obtain all <a href="noe.html">NOE</a> information in a molecule by a single experiment and without prior knowledge of the spectral assignment or molecular structure. (Bruker code: noesyph)</p>
<p><a href="pendant.html"><b>PENDANT</b></a>
<p>The PENDANT experiment (Polarisation ENhancement During Attached Nucleus Testing) is similar to the DEPT sequence, but also shows quarternary carbon atoms in the spectrum. (Bruker code: pendant)</p>
<p><a href="relayed_cosy.html"><b>Relayed COSY</b></a></p>
<p>The Relayed COSY experiment shows cross peaks for couplings over three and four bonds (in contrast to the simple COSY, which only shows coupling over three bonds). (Bruker code: cosyqfri)</p>
<p><a href="roesyph.html"><b>ROESY</b></a></p>
<p>The Rotating-frame Overhauser SpectroscopY offers means to obtain NOE information in larger molecules with short <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>-times. (Bruker code: roesyph)</p>
<p><a href="secsyqf.html"><b>SECSY</b></a></p>
<p>The Spin Echo Correlated SpectroscopY is comparable to the COSY experiment, but produces a skewed spectrum that uses half the amount of storage. (Bruker code: secsyqf)</p>
<p><a href="mlevph.html"><b>TOCSY</b></a></p>

<p><a href="zfilter.html"><b><i>z</i>-COSY</b></a></p>
<p>The <i>z</i>-COSY experiment uses a <i>z</i>-filter to dephase unwanted coherences and produce a COSY spectrum with clean signals and narrow diagonal peaks. (Bruker code: cosygpzfqf)</p>
