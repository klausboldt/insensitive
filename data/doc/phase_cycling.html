Phase cycling

<p>
Phase cycling is a method to suppress signals in the NMR spectrum and selecting certain
<a href="coherence_pathways.html">coherence pathways</a> by systematically varying the
<a href="phase.html">phase</a> of pulses in a <a href="pulse_sequences.html">pulse sequence</a> and of 
the receiver coil. By adding two spectra that have been recorded with a phase shift of 180&deg; between 
same spins the resulting spectral lines cancel each other out. This can be used in more complex pulse 
sequences to remove unwanted peaks, while other peaks of interest are retained. A good example of this 
technique is the <a href="inad1d.html">INADEQUATE</a> experiment in which the uncoupled <sup>13</sup>C 
signals are removed to reveal the <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>13</sup>C satellites as 
<a href="antiphase_magnetization.html">antiphase peaks</a>.

<p>
If a pulse's phase is changed in a phase cycle this is usually symbolised by denoting the phase as 
<i>&phi;</i> instead of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, etc.
