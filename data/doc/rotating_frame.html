In the laboratory frame the spins <a href="precession.html">precess</a> around the axis of the applied 
field with the <a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequency</a> <i>&omega;</i><sup>0</sup> that is 
defined by the field strength <b>B</b> and the <a href="gyromagnetic_ratio.html">gyromagnetic ratio</a> 
<i>&gamma;</i> of the nucleus. <i>&omega;</i><sup>0</sup> is in the order of several hundred MHz, but each
spin's Larmor frequency deviates slightly from this frequency due to local field effects from 
<a href="chemical_shift.html">chemical shifts</a> and <a href="coupling.html">coupling</a> to other spins.
These small shifts are on a much smaller scale than <i>&omega;</i><sup>0</sup>. Therefore the frequency of
precession is often given relative to a reference frequency <i>&omega;</i><sup>ref</sup>.

This can be visualised as a frame of reference that rotates around the z-axis with the same velocity as 
the spins do. A spin with a Larmor frequency equal to <i>&omega;</i><sup>ref</sup> appears 
stationary while other spins precess slightly slower or faster on the scale of several Hertz. All vectors 
in Insensitive are given in the coordinates of the rotating frame.
