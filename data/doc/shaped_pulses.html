            A radiofrequency <a href="pulse.html">pulse</a> in NMR is normally assumed to be of approximately
            rectangular shape, i.e. the <b>B</b><sub>1</sub> field with frequency &Omega;<sup>0</sup> is switched
            on with a constant power &gamma;<b>B</b><sub>1</sub> for a specific time <i>t</i> and then turned off
            again. Such a field that has limited duration has a finite frequency spectrum based on
            <a href="quantum_mechanics.html">Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle</a>. The spectrum can be calculated
            from the pulse shape using <a href="fourier_transformation.html">Fourier transformation</a>. A rectangular
            function transforms into sinc(</>x</i>) = sin(<i>x</i>)/<i>x</i>, which implies that the
            field experienced by spins with a <a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequency</a> with an offset from
            &Omega;<sup>0</sup> undergoes frequency-dependent oscillations.

            <p>
            The excitation profile does not match the Fourier transformation of the pulse shape exactly, because one
            has to consider off-resonance effects: if the frequency of the rf-field does not match the Larmor
            frequency of a <a href="spin.html">spin</a> exactly the spin will experience both the <b>B</b><sub>1</sub>
            and <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> field with a ratio defined by the resonance offset. Aside from a smaller
            <a href="flip_angle.html">flip angle</a> than for an on-resonance spin the magnetisation will also
            acquire a <a href="phase.html">phase shift</a>. In the Pulse Shape module this excitation profile of a
            pulse can be plotted as either absolute <i>M<sub>xy</sub></i> magnetisation and phase shift, as
            <i>M<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>M<sub>y</sub></i> components, and as the residual <i>M<sub>z</sub></i>
            magnetisation.

            <p>
            For full excitation of a whole spectrum short, hard, rectangular pulses can cover the complete spectral
            range. Off-resonance effects are more severe for nuclei with a wider range of <a href="chemical_shift.html">
            chemical shifts</a> (e.g. <sup>13</sup>C compared to <sup>1</sup>H). This is reflected in slightly
            smaller signal intensities far away from the spectrum centre. The phase shift for large frequency offsets
            can be easily corrected using first order phase correction. However, for selective, soft pulses the
            off-resonance oscillations of the excitation profile poses a problem due to unwanted, weak excitation of
            the whole spectrum. This can be circumvented by <i>shaped pulses</i>.

            <p><b>Gauss pulses</b></p>
            <p>
            The Fourier transform of a Gauss function is again a Gauss function. The width in the frequency domain is
            reciprocal to the one in time domain, which implies that with a long Gauss pulse a limited range of the
            spectrum can be excited, while no unwanted excitation occurs outside that range. The disadvantage is that
            the excitation profile of a Gauss pulse causes excitations with different intensities and strong phase
            shifts across the width of the Gauss profile.

            <p><b>Sinc pulses</b></p>
            <p>
            Reciprocity of the Fourier transformation implies that the excitation profile of a sinc(<i>x</i>) pulse
            shape will be a rectangular function. This allows for selective excitation of a limited range of the
            spectrum with near constant intensity. However, the spins still experience a strong frequency-dependent
            phase shift.
            </p>
            <p><b>BURP pulses</b></p>
            <p>
            Approximately rectangular excitation profiles with small phase shifts have been achieved with the so-called
            BURP pulses. These have complex shapes composed of several sine and cosine functions and complex trajectories
            of the magnetisation vectors. They have been conceived by reverse engineering the desired excitation profile.
            Several versions exist for 90&deg; excitation (E-BURP, U-BURP) and 180&deg; inversion (I-BURP, RE-BURP) pulses.

            <p><b>DANTE pulse train</b></p>
            <p>
            Very selective pulses have been realised using the DANTE sequence (Delay Alternating Nutation Tailored
            Excitation). It is composed of equally spaced, short pulses that together cause on-resonance spins to
            flip for the desired angle. In the periods between the short pulses off-resonance spins will precess
            around <op>Iz</op> and effects of the pulse is averaged out. For a narrower excitation profile a
            larger number of shorter pulses is required. Additionally to the on-resonance excitation additional
            regions of the spectrum get excited, which appear at distances of 1/&Delta;<i>t</i> from the resonance
            frequency, with &Delta;<i>t</i> being the period between two pulses. This can also be understood by
            looking at the Fourier transformation of a comb function (equally spaced &delta;-functions), which is
            again a comb function.
