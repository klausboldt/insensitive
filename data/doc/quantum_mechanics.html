The discovery that led to the development of quantum mechanics was, that on an atomic scale energy <i>E</i> 
seems to be exchanged only in multiples of Planck's constant <i>h</i> = 6.626 &middot; 10<sup>-34</sup> J. 
</p>

<p>
This led to the conclusion that a quantum mechanical entity (e.g. an electron, a photon or an atomic 
nucleus) takes both the form of a wave and a particle, depending on which property is measured 
and how. The relationship between both aspects is given by the <i>de Broglie</i> relation:
</p>
<center><img src="formula_de_broglie.png" height="41" width="46"></center>
<p>
Here, <i>&lambda;</i> is the wavelength and <i>p</i> the momentum, which are quantities that correspond 
to either wave or particle. The physical system is described as a wave function &Psi;, the absolute 
square of which is proportional to the position probability density.<br>
Physical properties are replaced by operators, which, applied to the wave function, give the measurable 
quantity in form of an eigenvalue equation.
</p>
<center><img src="formula_eigenvalue_equation.png" height="18" width="76"></center>
<p>
In this equation &Psi; is called an eigenfunction of the operator &Omega; and <i>&omega;</i> the 
eigenvalue that corresponds to the eigenfunction. If a quantum mechanical system is in a state that is 
described by an eigenfunction, the measured value will be the corresponding eigenvalue. If the system's 
state is composed of a linear combination of any possible eigenfunctions (called a 
mixed state or superposition state), the measured value will be one of the possible eigenvalues. The 
probability with which it is measured is defined by the coefficient to the corresponding eigenfunction 
in the linear combination. The mean value for the measurement is called the expectation value.
</p>
<p>
From the wave-particle duality follows one of the most fundamental relations in quantum mechanics that 
is known as the uncertainty principle: It is physically impossible to measure certain pairs of physical 
properties <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> with infinite precision, e.g. the position <i>x</i> and momentum <i>p</i>. 
The product of the uncertainties &Delta;<i>x</i> and &Delta;<i>p</i> with which two observables are 
measured is always larger or equal to <i>h</i>/4&pi;. The unit of the product <i>pq</i> is that of an 
action or a rotational momentum [Js].
</p>

<p>
This is always the case when the order in which two operators that represent the physical properties are 
applied to one another is not interchangeable. One says the operators do not commute. The difference 
between the two possible products gives the reduced Planck constant multiplied by the imaginary unit 
<i>i</i> and is called the commutator of the two operators:
</p>
<center><img src="formula_commutator.png" height="19" width="169"></center>
<p>
If one of two non-commuting quantities is precisely known, the measurement of the second quantity will 
result in completely arbitrary eigenvalues of the second operator.
</p>
<p><b>Schr&ouml;dinger equation</b></p>
<p>
A special operator is the Hamiltonian, the eigenvalues of which are the energy states of the system. The 
eigenvalue equation is called the Schr&ouml;dinger equation and takes the time-independent form
</p>
<center><img src="formula_schroedinger_equation.png" height="21" width="78"></center>
<p>
The Hamiltonian is conveniently written in natural units by dividing the standard Hamiltonian by 
<i>h</i>/2&pi;. Its eigenvalues are then measured in angular frequency <i>&omega;</i> which is directly 
measured in the NMR experiment.
</p>
<center><img src="formula_schroedinger_natural.png" height="21" width="75"></center>
<p>
The time-dependent form is called the <a href="equation_of_motion.html">equation of motion</a>. Every 
system that is not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian will evolve over time into one of the eigenstates.
</p>
<center><img src="formula_equation_of_motion.png" height="38" width="109"></center>
<p><b>Matrix mechanics</b></p>
<p>
A different approach to describe quantum mechanics can be derived from the fact that the commutator 
follows the rules of <a href="matrix_multiplication.html">matrix multiplication</a>. Every operator can 
be constructed as a square, hermitian <a href="matrix.html">matrix</a> with the diagonal elements denoting 
quantum states of the system and the off-diagonal elements representing transitions between states. If the 
matrix is in diagonal form the diagonal elements are the operator's eigenvalues. The operators work on vectors 
in <a href="hilbert_space.html">Hilbert space</a>, an <i>n</i>-dimensional, complex vector space with as 
many dimensions as possible states in the quantum system. In the eigenvalue equation the operator is 
applied to the eigenvector, comprising of the coefficients for each eigenstate, and results in the 
eigenvalue multiplied with the eigenvector.
</p>
<center><img src="formula_eigenvector.png" height="44" width="216"></center>
<p>
Two operators commute if they have the same set of
eigenvectors. Two non-commuting operators cannot both have the same set of eigenvectors. One of them is
therefore bound to change the quantum state when a measurement of both quantities is applied, thus resulting
in Heisenberg's prediction that both quantities cannot be determined with absolute accuracy.
</p>
<p><b>Dirac notation</b></p>
<p>
Each state can be unambiguously defined by a set of quantum numbers. These are integer values 
(half-integer in the case of <a href="spin.html">spin</a>). A quantum mechanical state in Hilbert space 
depending on the quantum number <i>n</i> can thus be written as
</p>
<center><img src="formula_ket.png" height="19" width="107"></center>
<p>
called "ket-<i>n</i>". The complex conjugate (and transpose in case of matrix mechanics) value is called 
"bra-<i>n</i>" and written as
</p>
<center><img src="formula_bra.png" height="19" width="107"></center>
<p>
The bra-ket already implies normalisation over infinite space.
</p>
<center><img src="formula_normalization.png" height="40" width="177"></center>
<p>
Matrix elements are in general complex numbers and are represented as bra-operator-ket products
</p>
<center><img src="formula_matrix_element.png" height="22" width="119"></center>
<p>
in which the ket and bra quantum numbers identify the row and column index of the operator matrix 
<i>&Omega;</i>.<br>
<br>
The ket-bra product forms a square matrix with the matrix element that is defined by the quantum numbers 
of the ket and the bra being 1 and the rest being 0. 
</p>
<center><img src="formula_ket_bra.png" height="39" width="95"></center>
<p>
The sum of all ket-bra products of the same quantum numbers is equal to the identity matrix with the 
dimension of the quantum mechanical system. It plays an important role in the construction of the 
<a href="density_matrix.html">density operator</a>.
