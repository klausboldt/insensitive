If a spin system with observable, transverse magnetisation is left alone the magnetisation vectors will 
<a href="precession.html">precess</a> around the z-axis, <a href="coupling.html">coupling</a> between 
spins will create and destroy <a href="antiphase_magnetization.html">antiphase magnetisation</a> and 
<a href="relaxation.html">relaxation</a> will return the system to thermal equilibrium. If this signal is 
detected by measuring the induction in a receiver coil, one acquires a dampened sine and cosine 
signal called the <i>free induction decay</i> or FID. The time constant of the dampening is the 
transversal relaxation time <i>T</i><sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup>.<br>
The NMR spectrum is the <a href="fourier_transformation.html">Fourier transform</a> of the FID.

<p><b>Quadrature detection</b></p>
<p>
In order to tell the difference between clockwise and counterclockwise precession relative to the 
reference frequency in the <a href="rotating_frame.html">rotating frame</a>, it is necessary to 
detect a complex signal with two orthogonal detectors in the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i>-plane. In the actual 
<a href="spectrometer.html">spectrometer</a> hardware this is implemented by splitting the receiver 
signal in two and <a href="phase.html">phase</a> shifting one of them by 90&deg;. This method is called 
quadrature detection. The phase shift works fine for directly detected FIDs, but has to be introduced
by other <a href="pure_phase_spectra.html">methods</a> for the indirect time variable in 
<a href="two_dimensional_spectra.html">2D spectra</a>.
