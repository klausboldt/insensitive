            There are two parameters that influence the way an acquired spectrum turns out. They are the 
            dwell time and the number of data points. Both can be set in the acquisition settings of 
            Insensitive's main window.
            </p>
            <p>
            The dwell time or sampling interval <i>&tau;</i><sub>sample</sub> is the time delay between 
            two data points. It determines the high frequency limit of the spectral resolution, called the 
            Nyquist frequency. If <i>&tau;</i><sub>sample</sub> is smaller than 
            1/(2<i>&omega;</i><sub>0</sub>) with <i>&omega;</i><sub>0</sub> being the oscillation's angular
            frequency, the signal will oscillate several times between two adjacent data points and not be 
            recorded. The signal is therefore mistaken for a lower frequency, the spectrum wraps around 
            and the peak appears at a wrong position. A longer dwell time translates to a smaller 
            frequency window being visible in the spectrum.

            <p>
            With a constant dwell time the total number of data points <i>N</i> that is recorded 
            determines the spectrum resolution. To resolve peaks in more detail, <i>N</i> must be 
            raised. This can be done either by actually acquiring more data, or by simply appending
            a string of zeros at the end of the <a href="fid.html">FID</a>, called <i>zero filling</i>. 
            While this method does not increase the information encoded in the spectrum, i.e. it does not 
            resolve more peaks than in the original data, it does smoothen the spectrum. Due to the 
            algorithm of Fast <a href="fourier_transformation.html">Fourier Transformation</a> (FFT) the 
            number of data points must be a power of two.

            <p>
            The lowest frequency resolved in the spectrum is determined by the total detection time 
            <i>N&tau;</i><sub>sample</sub>.

            In addition, two factors that contribute to spectral resolution and cannot simply be adjusted
            at the <a href="spectrometer.html">spectrometer</a> are spin <a href="relaxation.html">
            relaxation</a>, which broadens the peaks, and the magnetic field strength. At higher fields
            the <a href="energy_levels.html">energy levels</a> are more separated and the resolution of
            individual peaks is increased.
