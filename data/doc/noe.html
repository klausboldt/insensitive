Nuclear Overhauser Effect
</h1>
</div>

<div>
<p>
The Nuclear Overhauser Effect or NOE is the enhancement of one spin's signal due to magnetisation transfer
via cross <a href="relaxation.html">relaxation</a> in a dipolar coupled spin system. In the steady state 
NOE one transition between two spins in an AX system is selectively saturated by an <a href="pulse.html">
rf-pulse</a>. This disturbs the equilibrium population, and the system will start to relax to a new 
equilibrium state. If <a href="dipolar_coupling.html">dipolar couplings</a> are present the populations 
will be replenished or depleted through double-quantum transitions <i>W</i><sub>2</sub> (small molecules) 
or zero-quantum transitions <i>W</i><sub>0</sub> (large molecules).

The transfer of magnetisation between spins is described by the Solomon equations, which can be derived
from the relaxation <a href="matrix.html">matrix</a> by <a href="matrix_diagonalization.html">
transformation</a> into a basis of Zeeman eigenstates. For two-spin system they are given by:
</p>
<center><img src="formula_solomon_equation.png" style="width:100%; max-width:403px;"></center>
<p>
<i>R</i><sub>auto</sub> is called the auto relaxation constant which defines the leakage of 
magnetisation to the lattice.
</p>

<p>
The cross relaxation constant <i>R</i><sub>cross</sub> expresses the exchange of magnetisation between 
two dipolar coupled spins.
</p>

<p>  
Depending on the size of the molecules (more precisely, the correlation time <i>&tau;<sub>c</sub></i>) the 
magnetisation of the second spin will be enhanced or reduced. For medium sized molecules the zero- and 
double-quantum transition probabilities cancel and the NOE is not observable.<br>
In the fast motion limit the efficiency 
<i>&epsilon;</i><sub>NOE</sub> = <i>&gamma;</i><sub>I</sub>/2<i>&gamma;</i><sub>S</sub> is given by the 
quotient of <a href="gyromagnetic_ratio.html">gyromagnetic ratios</a> of the coupled spins.
</p>

<p>
The disappearing NOE for medium-sized molecules can be circumvented by measuring relaxation during the 
application of a <a href="spin_lock.html">spin lock</a> field. Under these conditions the spins are held 
constant along the axis of an applied rf-field in the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i>-plane of the 
<a href="rotating_frame.html">rotating frame</a> and kept from <a href="precession.html">precessing</a>.
Under the influence of this <a href="decoupling.html">decoupling</a> field the spins relax with 
a time constant <i>T</i><sub>1<i>&rho;</i></sub> towards equal <a href="populations.html">population</a> 
of <i>&alpha;</i> and <i>&beta;</i> states and zero magnetisation.
</p>
<center><img src="formula_solomon_equation_roe.png" style="width:100%; max-width:330px;"></center>
<p>
This is called the rotating frame Overhauser effect (ROE) with the auto and cross relaxation constants
</p>
<center><img src="formula_auto_relaxation_roe.png" width="215" height="23"></center>
<p>
and
</p>
<center><img src="formula_cross_relaxation_roe.png" width="160" height="23"></center>
<p>
Since both <i>W</i><sub>0</sub> and <i>W</i><sub>2</sub> have positive coefficients the ROE never 
disappears for any correlation time.
</p>
<p>
Since the dipolar coupling and hence the cross relaxation is proportional to the distance 
<i>r</i><sup>-6</sup> the NOE and ROE can be used for measuring distances between spins. This is done in 
the <a href="noesyph.html">NOESY</a> and <a href="roesyph.html">ROESY</a> experiments. Furthermore, the NOE 
is employed for signal enhancement during heteronuclear <a href="decoupling.html">decoupling</a>.
