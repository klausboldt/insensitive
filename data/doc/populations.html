An operator for a quantum mechanical system, like the Hamiltonian, has a number of eigenstates which are 
time-independent. These correspond to the spins being oriented either in parallel (<i>&alpha;</i>) or 
antiparallel (<i>&beta;</i>) to the external magnetic field. The <i>&alpha;</i>-state translates into a 
magnetic moment along the <i>z</i>-axis (red vector), the <i>&beta;</i>-state is a magnetic moment along 
-<i>z</i>.

<p>
Each spin can be in any of these states or in a superposition of any number of states and thus populate a 
number of eigenstates. The real coefficients for these states are called populations. In a 
<a href="density_matrix.html">density matrix</a> the populations are represented by the diagonal elements.
</p>
<p>
The simplest model of NMR represents only the energy levels and populations, as well as the transitions 
between energy levels. In case of system of two coupled spins 1/2 there are four possible 
<a href="energy_levels.html">energy levels</a>.

This model explains the NMR signal as transitions between states. Only the single quantum transitions with
the transition probability <i>W</i><sub>1</sub> are observable. Other transitions that involve the flip of
two or more spins can be induced by dipole-dipole interactions and are important for 
<a href="relaxation.html">relaxation</a>.

In a three spin system the energy levels are drawn in a pseudo-3D perspective. Each colour (red, blue, 
orange) stands for one kind of spins being flipped with the violet arrows denoting multi-quantum 
transitions.
