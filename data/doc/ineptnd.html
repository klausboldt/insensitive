The Insensitive Nuclei Enhanced by Polarisation Transfer experiment is used to transfer magnetisation 
from a sensitive nucleus (normally <sup>1</sup>H) to a less sensitive nucleus via scalar coupling 
(Bruker code: ineptnd). The maximum efficiency for magnetisation transfer is larger than via 
<a href="noe.html">NOE</a> during <a href="decoupling.html">decoupling</a>. The delay has to be 
optimised for each coupling constant. A complete magnetisation transfer from <op>I</op> to <op>S</op> 
spins is possible if the delay time is <i>&tau;</i> = 1/(2<i>J</i>).

Set up a two-spin system consisting of an I-spin and an S-spin with a coupling constant of 0.25 Hz. Set 
the chemical shifts to <i>&Omega;<sub>I</sub></i> = 0.3 Hz and <i>&Omega;<sub>S</sub></i> = -0.7 Hz, with 
a distance <i>r</i> = 0.2 nm.
</p>
<p>
The magnetisation of a certain spin depends on the <a href="gyromagnetic_ratio.html">gyromagnetic 
ratio</a> of the nucleus. The magnetic moment of <sup>13</sup>C is about 1/4 the moment of <sup>1</sup>H. 
The equilibrium state is thus defined by the terms <op>I1z + 0.25 S2z</op>.<br>
A 90&deg;-pulse on the I-spin creates transverse magnetisation. This is followed by a 
<a href="spin_echo_sandwich.html">spin echo sandwich</a> with 180&deg;-pulses on both spin types. In this 
period only the coupling and no <a href="chemical_shift.html">chemical shift</a> evolves. Before the 
second 90&deg;-pulse the spin system is in a state of <a href="antiphase_magnetization.html">
antiphase magnetisation</a> <op>-2I1xS2z - 0.25 S2z</op>. The 90&deg;<sub>y</sub>-pulse on the I-spins 
creates an intermediate state of <a href="longitudinal_two_spin_order.html">longitudinal two-spin order</a> 
<op>2I1zS2z - 0.25 S2z</op> which is transformed into the antiphase term <op>-2I1zS2y + 0.25 S2y</op> 
by the 90&deg;<sub>x</sub>-pulse on the S-spins. Since the magnetisation started on I-spins the amplitude 
is still that of the sensitive nuclei. The result is an antiphase doublet added to the weaker in-phase 
doublet of the S-spins. The difference in peak height can be removed by <a href="phase_cycling.html">phase
cycling</a>.
</p>
<p>
Because of the antiphase <a href="lineshapes.html">line shapes</a>, decoupling can be performed during
the sequence. The antiphase lines would collapse to zero, removing every trace of the gained signal. The 
INEPT sequence has therefore been extended to let the spins return to in-phase magnetisation with 
another spin echo sandwich before acquisition (Bruker code: ineptrd). However, this happens on the cost of 
enhancement due to <a href="relaxation.html">relaxation</a> during the longer 
<a href="pulse_sequences.html">pulse sequence</a>.

<p>
The INEPT transfer sequence can be found in many heteronuclear NMR experiments like the 
<a href="hsqcph.html">HSQC</a>, where it is used to transfer magnetisation both to the insensitive 
nuclei and back to the more sensitive ones for detection.
