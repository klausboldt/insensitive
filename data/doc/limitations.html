Limitations
</h1>
</div>

<div>
<p>
The simulation of spins in Insensitive has a number of limitations:
</p>
<p>
The vector display and animations are programmed to be intuitive and instructional rather than physically accurate.
The units for delay and dwell times, relaxation constants, and spin system parameters are optimised for display.
Small values should therefore be preferred when choosing <a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequencies</a>
and coupling constants. A frequency of 1 Hz will be correctly displayed as one rotation per second, while a more
accurate frequency of 1 kHz for a proton spin is too fast the animation's resolution. Accordingly, coupling
constants should be set in the order of magnitude of 10<sup>-1</sup> Hz. 
</p>
<p>
The simulation is limited to four magnetically inequivalent spins in isotropic solution with <i>I</i> = 
1/2 and two spin types I and S. The <a href="gyromagnetic_ratio.html">gyromagnetic ratios</a> of these spin
types can be selected from a list of common spins 1/2.
</p>
<p>
Since Insensitive is based on the <a href="density_matrix.html">density matrix</a> approach and describes an 
ensemble of spins a 180&deg;-pulse will not lead to a <a href="spin_echo_sandwich.html">spin echo</a>, because 
only the total angular momenta are simulated and individual spins do not get refocussed. Several different spins
must be used to simulate a spin echo.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="precession.html">precession</a> is simulated only in the <a href="rotating_frame.html">
rotating frame</a> and not in the laboratory frame. Each spin type is viewed in its own rotating frame and no
offset needs to be introduced in the <a href="spineditor.html">Spin Editor</a> between I and S spins. If
both spin types are recorded in the <a href="fid.html">FID</a> they will appear overlayed in the same spectrum.
</p>
<p>
Quadrupolar interaction and chemical shift anisotropy are not taken into account for 
<a href="relaxation.html">relaxation</a>. 
</p>
<p>
For certain strongly coupled 4 spin systems the <a href="energy_levels.html">energy level</a> diagram
exhibits a breaking of rotational symmetry by showing some additional, spin forbidden transition. They only
show up for some orientations of the spin system and appear to be caused by the LAPACK linear algebra routines
when <a href="matrix_diagonalization.html">diagonalising</a> of the hamiltonian matrix.
</p>
<p>
Some of the operations, especially for <a href="two_dimensional_spectra.html">2D spectra</a>, require a 
lot of calculations, which scale exponentially with the number of spins. Disable computing-intensive 
features like strong coupling and dipolar relaxation, and lower the number of spins and spectrum 
<a href="spectrum_resolution.html">resolution</a> to increase speed.
</p>
<p>
The number of calculations necessary for the display of <a href="coherence_pathways.html">coherence pathways</a>
depends on the number of spins and scales exponentially with the number of pulses in the
<a href="pulse_sequences.html">pulse sequence</a>. The computation may take some time and will not be performed
for a high number of calculations. The limit can be set in the preferences. Support for coherence pathways
is experimental. The variable evolution time <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> is treated as a constant delay.
</p>
<p>
If <a href="coupling.html">strong coupling</a> is activated the flip-flop exchange between <i>&alpha;&beta;</i>
and <i>&beta;&alpha;</i> states depends on their relative populations. This causes a dependency of the 
effects of strong coupling on the sampling time <i>&tau;</i><sub>sample</sub>. The separate application of 
<a href="chemical_shift.html">chemical shift</a> and coupling is therefore disabled by default if strong 
coupling is activated.<br>
