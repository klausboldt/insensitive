<p>
In a heteronuclear spin system of an <i>I</i> and an <i>S</i> spin, e.g. a <a href="coupling.html">
coupled</a> spin pair of a <sup>1</sup>H and a <sup>15</sup>N nucleus in a protein backbone, the 
<i>S</i> spin is subject to <a href="dipolar_coupling.html">dipolar coupling</a> and 
<a href="chemical shift.html">chemical shift anisotropy</a>. The magnetic fields due to the proton 
<a href="spin.html">spin</a> orientation and the electron ring currents are always opposed if the proton
is in its <i>&beta;</i> state and point in the same direction if it is in its <i>&alpha;</i> state, 
independent from the molecule's orientation to the external magnetic field. Dipolar 
<a href="relaxation.html">relaxation</a> of the hetero spin is therefore dependent on the state of the 
coupling partner and causes a doublet with significantly different line widths. The peak caused by 
coupling to a proton in <i>&beta;</i> state is narrowed, while the linewidth for the spin coupled to a 
proton in <i>&alpha;</i> state is increased. This effect is more pronounced at high magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>
The transverse relaxation optimised spectroscopy (TROSY) removed the effects of line broadening in the 
spectrum by acquiring the <a href="fid.html">FID</a> without <a href="decoupling.html">decoupling</a> 
and then designing the <a href="pulse_sequences.html">pulse sequence</a> in a way that the magnetisation
is stored in slowly decaying <a href="coherences.html">coherences</a>. If decoupling was applied, the 
line width would be averaged and caused undecipherable spectra even if half of the coherences gave sharp
peaks. The family of TROSY sequences is the basis for measuring large proteins with very long 
correlation times <i>&tau;<sub>c</sub></i>.
</p>
<p>
TROSY spectra start from a state of <a href="longitudinal_two_spin_order.html">longitudinal two-spin 
order</a> <op>&plusmn;2IzSz</op>, which is created by a 90&deg;<sub><i>x</i></sub> <a href="pulse.html">
pulse</a> on the <i>I</i> spins, followed by a <a href="spin_echo_sandwich.html">spin echo sandwich</a>
on both spins with a total duration of 1/(2<i>J<sub>IS</sub></i>), and a second 90&deg; pulse with a
&plusmn;90&deg; <a href="phase.html">phase</a> shift. The TROSY sequence can be included in experiments 
like the <a href="hsqcph.html">HSQC</a> (minus the decoupling pulses), where the broad signals are then 
removed by <a href="phase_cycling.html">phase cycling</a>.
