Antiphase magnetisation

<p>
Antiphase magnetisation is a state that is created within free evolution of two <a href="coupling.html">
coupled</a> spins. It represents the coherence of one spin (red vectors) linked to the 
<a href="populations.html">population</a> of the coupling partner (blue vectors) and is denoted as the product 
of a transverse magnetisation operator with an operator for z-magnetisation, e.g. <op>2I1xI2z</op>.

<p>
In the vector model of a spin ensemble this equals two magnetisation vectors in opposite directions, which 
cancel each other out. One vector results from spin 1 bound to spin 2 in <i>&alpha;</i>-state and causes the 
spins to <a href="precession.html">precess</a> faster than an uncoupled spin 1, while the second vector 
corresponds to spin 1 bound to spin 2 in <i>&beta;</i>-state, resulting in a precession that is 
slower than an unbound spin 1. This leads to the typical splitting of the coupled spin into a doublet.

Although antiphase magnetisation is not associated with a finite magnetic moment, it is made up of only 
simple single-quantum coherences and evolves into observable, transverse magnetisation over time.

<p>
The name comes from the fact that the peak shape depends on the state of the spin system at the time the
<a href="fid.html">acquisition</a> is started. A state of in-phase magnetisation like the 
<a href="coherences.html">coherence</a> <op>-I1y</op> causes a normal doublet, where both peaks have the same 
sign and <a href="phase.html">phase</a>, while antiphase magnetisation <op>2I1yI2z</op> results in a 
characteristic doublet with the two peaks having opposite signs. Antiphase peaks cannot be converted to 
in-phase peaks by phase correction.
