Multi-quantum coherence

<p>
Multi-quantum coherences are coherent superpositions of two or more <a href="spin.html">spins</a> in a
system, linked by a defined <a href="phase.html">phase</a> relationship. For example, the multi-quantum
coherence <op>2I1xI2x</op> carries the information that if the magnetisation of spin 1 (red) points in
<i>x</i> direction, the same holds for spin 2 (blue). However, the spins can also both point in
-<i>x</i> direction with the same probability. With no preference for either positive or negative
direction, multi-quantum coherences do not result in any observable magnetisation and are not visible
in the vector representation of a spin system.

<p>
The <op>-2I1xI2x</op> operator represents those spins in which the coherences of the two couples spins
point in the opposite direction (spin 1 points in <i>x</i> if spin 2 points in -<i>x</i> and vice versa.)
Similarly, in case of the operator <op>2I1xI2y</op> the magnetic moments of spin 1 (red) and spin 2 (blue)
have a phase shift of +90&deg;, again with equal probability that both coherences have either positive
or negative sign.

Multi-quantum coherences can be separated into linear combinations of
<a href="product_operator_formalism.html">product operators</a> in the <a href="spherical_tensors.html">
spherical tensor</a> basis:

<p>
The first summand is a double-quantum coherence, which <a href="precession.html">precesses</a> with
the sum of the <a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequencies</a> of the participating spins,
&Omega;<sub>1</sub> + &Omega;<sub>2</sub>. The second summand is the zero-quantum coherence that
precesses with the difference frequency, &Omega;<sub>1</sub> - &Omega;<sub>2</sub>. As with single-quantum
coherences, precession turns multi-quantum coherences from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i> to -<i>x</i> to -<i>y</i>.
Unlike single-quantum coherences, the <a href="coupling.html">coupling</a> propagator has no effect on
multi-quantum coherences, since all spins are in a mixed, coherent state and the
<a href="populations.html">populations</a> of the spins are unknown.

<p>
The <a href="matrix.html">matrix</a> representation of this operator has no non-zero matrix elements for 
populations or observable coherences. In many <a href="two_dimensional_spectra.html">2D techniques</a>,
multi-quantum coherences are used for transferring information between spins, like for example the
<a href="hmqcqf.html">HMQC</a> experiment.
