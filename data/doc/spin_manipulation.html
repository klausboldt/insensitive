            The Spin State panel provides representations for three physical models of a spin ensemble, the
            <a href="vector_model.html">vector model</a>, <a href="density_matrix.html">density matrix</a>, and
            <a href="product_operator_formalism.html">product operators</a>. On the right hand side the
            <a href="settings.html">parameters</a> that control the behaviour of the spin ensemble can be set up.
            7 buttons at the bottom of the window allow to manipulate the spin state using <a href="pulse.html">
            pulses</a>, free evolution, and <a href="gradients.html">gradients</a>.
            </p>
            <center><img src="img_spinstate.png" border="1" style="width:100%; max-width:1163px;"></center>
            
            <p><b>Vector Representation</b></p>
            <p>
            The spin ensemble is given as a geometrical representation in the form of vectors in a cartesian
            coordinate system. Not all spin states are visible in this mode. This limitation is deliberate in order
            to show this model's failure to explain <a href="coherence_transfer.html">coherence transfer</a>.<br>
            <br>
            If both spin types are present the vector diagram shows the two possible spin types side by side in
            separate graphs. I spins are drawn in red, while S spins are blue. The magnitude of the respective vectors
            reflect the <a href="gyromagnetic_ratio.html">gyromagnetic ratios</a> of the spins, but not the isotope's
            natural abundance. Vectors that belong to the spin highlighted in the Spin Network Editor are displayed in
            a lighter colour. Three display modes are available from the settings panel: "x,y,z" shows a 3D plot in a
            unit sphere with the vertical <i>z</i>-axis representing the direction of the external magnetic field.
            "x,y-Plane" only shows the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes that contain observable <a href="coherences.html">
            coherences</a>. "Grapefruit" also displays a 3D coordinate system and additionally shows spin trajectories
            of applied pulses and during animated precession and spectrum acquisition.
            </p>
            <p><b>Density Matrix</b></p>
            <p>
            Below the vector model the density matrix is shown, which is the direct representation of the spin state
            modelled by Insensitive. The displayed density matrix is normalised so that the product operator's
            amplitude in equilibrium is 1 for <sup>1</sup>H nuclei. The observable
            <a href="single_quantum_coherence.html">single quantum coherences</a>, which give rise to signals in the
            spectrum, can be colour-coded by activating "Color 1st order coherences" in the settings panel.
            </p>
            <p><b>Product Operators</b></p>
            <p>
            Below the matrix the spin state is displayed as a linear combination of
            <a href="product_operator_formalism.html">product operators</a>. These can be displayed in a cartesian
            base, which is easily translated into a geometric representation, and in a
            <a href="spherical_tensors.html">spherical tensor</a> basis, which is useful to determine the
            <a href="coherences.html">coherence order</a>.
            </p>
            <p><b>Actions on the spin state</b></p>
            <p>
            Manipulation of the spin state can be performed using the nine buttons at the bottom of the main window.
            The following functions are available:
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="pulse.png" align="left" height="32" width="32" hspace="5">
            Apply a <a href="pulse.html"><b>Pulse</b></a> with flip angle <i>&beta;</i> and phase <i>&phi;</i> to all
            resonant spins as set in the <a href="settings.html">pulse settings</a>. Press the arrow on the button to
            access a menu with the most common pulses. The selected flip angle and phase are then automatically set
            in the pulse settings and will be available when clicking the pulse button again. During the following
            animation the buttons are unavailable.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="chemicalShift.png" align="left" height="32" width="32" hspace="5">
            Apply the <a href="chemical_shift.html"><b>Chemical Shift</b></a> as set for the Spin System to all
            spins. The result will be the spins after <a href="precession.html">precessing</a> for the
            delay time set in the <a href="settings.html">free evolution settings</a> without any spin-spin coupling.
            This function is not available if strong coupling is activated.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="coupling.png" align="left" height="32" width="32" hspace="5">
            Apply scalar <a href="coupling.html"><b>Coupling</b></a> as set for the Spin System for the delay
            time set in the free evolution settings to all spins. Strong coupling effects will be taken into
            account if the checkbox is activated in the settings. If <a href="decoupling.html">decoupling</a> is
            activated in the settings a simple 180&deg; decoupling sequence will be applied during this period.
            This function is not available if strong coupling is activated.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="relaxation.png" align="left" height="32" width="32" hspace="5">
            Apply the longitudinal and transverse <a href="relaxation.html"><b>Relaxation</b></a> as set in the free
            evolution settings to all spins in the system. Depending on whether "Dipolar relaxation" is deactivated
            or activated the relaxation will either be calculated from the empirical <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and
            <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> times or from the <a href="dipolar_coupling.html">dipolar coupling</a> constants and
            correlation time <i>&tau;<sub>c</sub></i>.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="freeEvolution.png" align="left" height="32" width="32" hspace="5">
            The <b>Evolution</b> button combines the functions of the Chemical Shift, Coupling, and (optionally)
            Relaxation buttons. Relaxation will only be considered if "Relaxation with evolution" is set in the
            free evolution settings. Free evolution can be applied continuously by selection "Animation" in the
            settings panel. If a <a href="pulse_sequence_manual.html">pulse sequence</a> is being recorded
            only this button is available, not the previous three separate operations.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="gradient.png" align="left" height="32" width="32" hspace="5">
            Apply a pulsed field <b><a href="gradients.html">Gradient</a></b> with the duration and strength set in 
            the settings panel. For simulating the gradient along the <i>z</i>-axis the spin state is split into 200
            slices, which will experience a position-dependent phase shift that is determined by the gradient pulse
            strength and duration.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="animation.png" align="left" height="32" width="32" hspace="5">
            When clicking <b>Acquire</b> recording of a spectrum will be started and the main window switches to
            the <a href="spectrum.html">spectrum display</a>. This operation ends recording of a pulse sequence.
            Clicking "Stop" will immediately stop the acquisition.
            </p>
            <p>
            <p>
            <img src="equilibrium.png" align="left" height="32" width="32" hspace="5">
            The <b>Equilibrium</b> button resets the spin state back to thermal equilibrium for a new experiment.
            All spins will return to their <op>Iz</op> state with excess population of the <i>&alpha;</i> state.
            </p>
            <p>
            <p>
            <img src="undo.png" align="left" height="32" width="32" hspace="5">
            Finally, <b>Undo</b> takes the spin state back to the previous value, undoing the last applied action
            applied via the action buttons or command line. Clicking undo a second time will redo that action.
            </p>
            <p>
            More advanced manipulation is possible using the <a href="commandline.html">command line</a>. This way
            one can directly apply <a href="product_operator_formalism.html">product operators</a> to the spin system,
            e.g. "<op>0.5 I1y</op>" for a 45&deg; pulse with a phase of 90&deg; on I spin 1, "<op>0.25 I2z</op>" for
            a chemical shift of I spin 2 for a delay of 0.25 s, or "<op>0.3 I2zS3z</op>" for <i>J</i>-coupling
            between spin 2 and spin 3 of types I and S, respectively, for a delay of 0.3 s.
            </p>
            <p><b>Editing the density matrix</b></p>
            <p>
            The Matrix Composer module, which can be started from the toolbar, provides the means to edit the spin
            state directly. A linear combination of cartesian product operators can be constructed and set up as the
            spin state by clicking "Update Matrix".
            </p>
            <center><img src="img_matrix_composer.png" border="1" style="width:100%; max-width:390px;"></center>
            <p>
            Add an operator by clicking "Add Operator", remove an operator by selecting the trash symbol on the right
            hand side of the operator row. Change an operator by selecting the single spin components from the popup
            buttons. Choose the identity operator <op>E/2</op> if a spin does not contribute to the operator. Set the
            operator coefficient in the textbox at the left hand side of the each operator.
