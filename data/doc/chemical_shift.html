Chemical shift

<p>
A spin's <a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequency</a> does not only depend on the external 
magnetic field <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> but also on the chemical environment that surrounds the spin. High 
electron density can shield a nucleus from <b>B</b><sub>0</sub>, while electron withdrawing groups 
deshield a nucleus. The effect is due to circular electron currents that are induced by the external 
magnetic field and generate a field <b>B</b><sub>induced</sub>.

<p>
The induced field can both weaken or strengthen the effective field due to diamagnetic and paramagnetic 
contributions, respectively. The shift in <a href="precession.html">precession</a> frequencies is small 
but large enough to be measured. This makes NMR such a useful tool for the determination of chemical 
structures.

<p>
To make the value device independent, chemical shift <i>&delta;</i> is usually given in ppm relative to the 
<a href="spectrometer.html">spectrometer</a> frequency as an offset to a standard. In case of <sup>1</sup>H 
and <sup>13</sup>C NMR tetramethyl silane (TMS) is used as a standard.
</p>
<p>
The chemical shift depends on the relative orientation of <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> to the molecule of the 
measured spin. If one defines a principal coordinate system in which the molecule is rigid, independent from 
its orientation to <b>B</b><sub>0</sub>, the chemical shift tensor <b>&delta;</b> takes a diagonal form.

<p>
The chemical shift in isotropic liquids is averaged to the isotropic chemical shift <i>&delta;</i> that is
equal to the average of the tensor's diagonal elements.
</p>
<p><b>Chemical shift anisotropy</b></p>
<p>
The orientation dependence or chemical shift anisotropy is expressed by the angle &Theta; between the 
coordinate of a principal tensor element and <b>B</b><sub>0</sub>.
</p>
<center><img src="formula_cs_anisotropy.png" height="22" width="180"></center>
<p>
The chemical shift anisotropy plays a role when the spins cannot rotate freely in the magnetic field and 
the chemical environment varies with the spins' orientation to the <b>B</b><sub>0</sub>-field. Strong 
effects can be observed in aromatic groups, where the magnetic field induces circular currents in the 
&pi;-system. Spins in plane with the electron current are strongly deshielded and shifted to lower fields, 
while spins directly on top or below the ring are shifted to higher fields.

<p>
In <a href="solid_state_nmr.html">solid state</a> samples this leads to a distribution of chemical shifts 
that appears as a broad peak shape with steep sides. The principal elements of the chemical shift tensor 
coincide the low-field and high-field end of the signal (<i>&delta;<sub>XX</sub></i> and 
<i>&delta;<sub>YY</sub></i>) and the centre maximum (<i>&delta;<sub>ZZ</sub></i>).

<p>
In axial symmetric, prolate molecules the centre peak coincides with the low field flank of the powder 
pattern. In axial symmetric, oblate molecules the centre peak coincides with the high field edge.
