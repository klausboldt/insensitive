            Insensitive has the possibility to create simple presentations for lectures and talks. All
            simulations and representations that are part of Insensitive can be freely positioned on a series
            of pages with an aspect ratio of 4:3 and presented in full screen.
            </p>

            <p>
            On the right hand side of the presentation window there are three panels that can be selected from
            the buttons at the top, <i>Objects</i>, <i>Images</i>, and <i>Settings</i>. The objects panel shows
            a list of all available Insensitive objects that can be used in the presentation, which are:
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spin network</li>
                <li>Vector model (I spins)</li>
                <li>Vector model (S spins)</li>
                <li>Energy level diagram</li>
                <li>Density matrix</li>
                <li>Product operators</li>
                <li>Pulse sequence</li>
                <li>Coherence pathways</li>
                <li>Phase cycling table</li>
                <li>Spectrum</li>
                <li>Pulse shape</li>
                <li>Pulse power spectrum</li>
                <li>An image</li>
                <li>A text field</li>
                <li>Control buttons</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            The image panel provides access to all images that are included with the Insensitive binary as part
            of the tutorial. Objects from both these panels can be placed onto the canvas by drag and drop.<br>
            The settings panel offers the same settings as the main window for the currently selected object.
            Depending on the object some setting may have no effect.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Working with frames</b></p>
            <p>
            If an Insensitive object is placed on the canvas and selected by clicking, a black frame appears around
            the object. If the objects retain their aspect ratio, for example images, the frame can be larger
            than the visible object, which appears centered. The frame can be resized by clicking and dragging
            one of the corners or edges. Frames can be movd by clicking on a non-responsive part of a frame and
            dragging. The current position relative to the top left corner is displayed during moving.<br>
            Frames can be deleted by clicking "Delete Frame" in the toolbar or pressing the backspace key. They
            can be reordered by selecting the "Bring to Front" or "Send to Back" buttons. When clicking an a stack
            of objects only the uppermost frame will be selected.<br>
            The font size and type can be changed for text fields or product operators with the "Fonts" panel
            from the toolbar.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Loading external data</b></p>
            <p>
            External data can be loaded into an object by selecting it and clicking "Import Content" in the
            toolbar. Depending on the type of object Insensitive will load different file types. Possible
            files are images, spin system files (&#42;.iss), pulse program files (&#42;.ipp) and spectrum
            files (&#42;.igg). Spin systems, pulse programs and spectra cannot be created or edited inside the
            presentation window, but must be saved from the respective windows in Insensitive and then imported.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Linking frames</b></p>
            <p>
            Each frame contains a complete Insensitive simulation engine that runs independently from the others.
            Frames can be linked by dragging the mouse from the grey circle with the chain symbol in the upper
            right corner of an activated frame and dropping it on another that shares the same data type
            (see image above). The settings for the frame from which the connection is drawn will be deleted and
            the frame will share the simulation with the target frame. If part of another shared simulation the
            frame will leave its previous network.<br>
            Examples for connections are a vector model, density matrix, and product operators sharing the same
            spin system, a vector model sharing the engine with the pulse shaper frames for selective pulses, or
            pulse sequence, coherence pathway and phase cycling table showing the same pulse program.<br>
            The controls, which initially display buttons to manipulate the spin system, change behaviour if they
            are connected to either spectra or the pulse shaper objects.<br>
            Press and hold the CTRL button to see which frames are linked.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Adding and removing slides</b></p>
            <p>
            Slides can be added or deleted by clicking the toolbar buttons "Add Page" or "Remove Page". A new
            page is inserted after the currently displayed slide. A slide can be selected from the "Select Page"
            dropdown menu.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Full screen mode</b></p>
            <p>
            Clicking on "Play" in the toolbar starts the presentation in full screen mode. Editing the slides is
            not possible in full screen. The presentation starts with the currently active slide. The previous or
            next slide can be selected by pressing the left or right cursor key. Full screen mode can be closed
            by clicking the button in the bottom left corner or pressing the escape key.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Opening and saving presentations</b></p>
            <p>
            Presentations can be saved in the &#42;.spinlecture format from the toolbar. A copy of Insensitive
            0.9.13 or higher is necessary to open the files. All data is contained inside the presentation file
            and imported content does not need to be kept separately.<br>
            Currently there is no automatic saving and the files need to be overwritten when a new version is
            saved.
