                Creating a Spin System
            </h1>

        <div>
            <p>
            To begin the simulation a spin system has to be created. At first launch of Insensitive this consists of
            two spins of spin type I with a <a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequency</a> of <i>&Omega;</i> = 0 Hz
            (in the <a href="rotating_frame.html">rotating frame</a>) and no <a href="coupling.html">scalar coupling</a>.
            The default distance between the spins is <i>r</i> = 0.30 nm, which corresponds to a
            <a href="dipolar_coupling.html">dipolar coupling</a> constant of <i>b</i> = -4450.69 Hz. To create an
            instructive simulation these parameters need to be adjusted. Spin systems, including the current spin state,
            can be opened and saved as Insensitive Spin System (*.iss) files using the "File" menu.
            </p>
            <p><b>Setting the spin number</b></p>
            <p>
            A maximum of 4 <a href="spin.html">spins</a> of two possible spin types, I and S, can be simulated. The
            number is limited by computing power of state-of-the-art computers. Click "Add Spin"/"Remove Spin" or edit the
            text field labelled "Spins" to change the number of spin in the spin system. "Remove Spin" removes the selected
            spin indicated by a blue glow. The spin system is displayed as
            red (I spins) and blue (S spins) spheres, which are connected by straight lines that symbolise coupling. The
            user can select whether the connections display scalar coupling (<i>J</i>), dipolar coupling (<i>b</i>), or
            distance (<i>r</i>).

            <p><b>Energy Levels</b></p>
            <p>
            On the right hand side the <a href="energy_levels.html">energy levels</a> of all spins are
            displayed as black lines, as well as observable single quantum transitions between states as red arrows.
            The transition arrows do no distiguish between degenerate levels. The levels are labelled with the spin states
            &alpha; or &beta; for each participating spin, or, in the case of strong coupling, as a wave function &psi; with
            a running number. For magnetically equivalent spins the symbols from the <a href="singlet_triplet_basis.html">
            singlet-triplet basis</a> are being used.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Setting the spin type</b></p>
            <p>
            The spin type can be changed between I and S by double tapping the respective spin icon.
            The spin types for I and S can be assigned to a number of common nuclei: <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C,
            <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>29</sup>Si, and <sup>31</sup>P. The standard setting is <sup>1</sup>H
            and <sup>13</sup>C for I and S spins, respectively. This setting will affect the
            <a href="gyromagnetic_ratio.html">gyromagnetic ratio</a> of the spins, but natural abundance will be ignored.
            Note that <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>29</sup>Si have a negative gyromagnetic ratio.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Setting the Larmor frequency</b></p>
            <p>
            A spin is selected by single clicking the spin icon. To change the Larmor frequency (and thus the
            <a href="chemical_shift.html">chemical shift</a>) of the active spin enter the new value in the text field
            indicated by <i>&Omega;</i> and press enter. The units can be displayed in Hertz or degrees per second (which
            can be set with the popup button "Units").
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Setting the coupling constants</b></p>
            <p>
            To set up coupling constants or spin-spin distances first enter the value for the constant that is currently
            being displayed  (<i>J</i>, <i>b</i> or <i>r</i>). Then click one spin and drag a connector to the coupling
            partner to set the value. Alternatively, if only two spins are present the value can be set by pressing enter.
            If the distance is set the dipolar coupling constant will be calculated automatically and vice versa.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Resetting and rotating the spin system</b></p>
            <p>
            Clicking "Reset Spins" will reset all spin types to I and set the chemical shifts and coupling constants to
            0 Hz and the distance between spins to 0.30 nm. "Rotate" will change the indices of the spins so that spin 1
            becomes spin 2 and so on, with the highest index being set to 1.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Considerations</b></p>
            <p>
            Avoid setting the frequencies to integer values, as the spin system will appear unchanged after the default
            delay time <i>&tau;</i> = 1.0 s. For an instructional simulation it is advisable to set the frequencies to
            values that are smaller than typical chemical shifts and coupling constants (e.g. <i>&Omega;</i><sub>1</sub> =
            0.2 Hz, <i>&Omega;</i><sub>2</sub> = -0.7 Hz, <i>J</i> = 0.25 Hz). This way the free evolution is easy to
            observe in steps and the effects of strong coupling are most pronounced. A good starting value for the
            spin-spin distance is 0.3 nm between two I spins, 0.2 nm between I and S spins and 0.13 nm between two S spins.
            For acquiring the spectrum set the dwell time to 0.1 s and the data poits to 512 (with zero filling) or 1024
            (without zero filling) for good spectral resolution.
