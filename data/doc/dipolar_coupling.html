Dipolar coupling
</h1>

<p>
Different spins in a molecule do not <a href="precession.html">precess</a> independently. If one spin can 
have different energy states depending on which state a nearby spin is in, these to spins are coupled.
There are two basic mechanisms by which information between coupled spins is exchanged: 
<a href="coupling.html"><i>J</i>-coupling</a> and dipolar coupling.
</p>
<p>
Dipolar coupling results from each spin generating a magnetic field that is oriented parallel to the 
nuclear spin vector. Two spins that are close to each other in space experience each other's magnetic 
field, which leads to an slightly different effective magnetic field <b>B</b><sub>eff</sub> at one spin 
that depends on the orientation of both magnetic dipoles. The strength of the dipole-dipole coupling 
depends strongly on the spin-spin distance <i>r</i><sup>-3</sup> as well as the 
<a href="gyromagnetic_ratio.html">gyromagnetic ratios</a> of the coupled spins. It is given by the 
dipole-dipole coupling constant <i>b</i><sub>12</sub> in units of rad/s.

<p>
The orientation dependence is expressed with the secular dipole-dipole coupling constant 
<i>d</i><sub>12</sub> through the angle &Theta; between the axis connecting the two spins and the external
magnetic field vector <b>B</b><sub>0</sub>. The secular approximation is valid in high magnetic fields.

<p>
As with the <a href="coupling.html">scalar coupling</a> one differentiates between a strong coupling 
regime where the <a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequencies</a> of the coupled spins and therefore
the energy levels are similar, and a weak coupling regime with large difference in Larmor frequencies and 
energy eigenvalues. In the strong coupling regime the coupling depends on all spacial components of the 
spin. This is the case for a homonuclear spin system.

<p>
For heteronuclear spin systems the coupling depends only on the spacial component along the external 
magnetic field <b>B</b><sub>0</sub>.

In an isotropic liquid the molecular orientations are rapidly changed by Brownian motion that is fast
on the timescale of NMR. Dipolar couplings are averaged out and cannot be observed. They are therefore 
not being simulated by Insensitive. The dipolar interactions do play a role in <a href="relaxation.html">
cross relaxation</a> processes and are the mechanism behind the <a href="noe.html">Nuclear Overhauser 
Enhancement</a>.
<br><br>
In liquid crystals and <a href="solid_state_nmr.html">solids</a> the molecular motion is restricted or 
suppressed. This leads to a splitting of the NMR signal into two lines for liquid crystals with a coupling 
constant of 3<i>d</i><sub>12</sub>. 
<br><br>
In powdered solids the dipole-dipole coupling is the major contribution to spin-spin coupling and leads 
to the characteristic Pake doublet with the secular coupling constant <i>d</i> between the two maxima.
</p>

<p>
The shape of the Pake pattern is due to the fact that there are only two possible orientations along the 
external magnetic field (parallel and antiparallel), but many orientations perpendicular to the 
<b>B</b><sub>0</sub>-field.
