Spin

'Spin' is a fundamental property of all matter like rest mass or electrical charge. Is is often 
described as a particle's rotational momentum <i>S</i> around its own axis (hence the name) and is 
associated with a magnetic dipole moment <i>&mu;<sub>s</sub></i> of the particle. In contrary to a normal 
rotational momentum like an electron's orbital momentum, the spin's quantum number <i>s</i> is constant 
for a class of particles and may take half integer values (1/2 in case of an electron or a proton):

Not only is the spin's absolute value quantised, but its possible orientations as well. 
<a href="quantum_mechanics.html">Quantum mechanics</a> states that the spin vector's projection on any 
axis (e.g. z-direction) can only take values between <i>s</i> and <i>-s</i> in integer steps. These 
different states are degenerate in the absence of a magnetic field but split up when a magnetic field is 
applied. This is called Zeeman splitting and is proportional to the magnetic field. The spin 
projection is defined by the projection quantum number <i>m<sub>s</sub></i>.

<p>
The cartesian components of any angular momentum do not <a href="quantum_mechanics.html">commute</a>. If 
one orientation <i>m<sub>s</sub></i> is known, the other two components are completely uncertain. 
<br>
After a magnetic field <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> (usually in <i>z</i>-direction) is applied, spins-1/2 will 
<a href="relaxation.html">relax</a> over time into one of two possible Zeeman states with 
<i>m<sub>s</sub></i> = 1/2 (<i>&alpha;</i>) or <i>m<sub>s</sub></i> = -1/2 (<i>&beta;</i>) in a Boltzmann 
distribution.

In a magnetic field the orientation quantisation forces the spins in an angle to the magnetic field 
vector. The force towards the <i>z</i>-direction causes the rotational axis of the spins to 
<a href="precession.html">precess</a> around <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> with an angular frequency 
<i>&omega;</i><sup>0</sup> determined by the spin's <a href="gyromagnetic_ratio.html">gyromagnetic 
ratio</a> <i>&gamma;</i> and the magnetic field strength <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> called the 
<a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequency</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="matrix_operators.html">operators</a> for the three spin orientations <i>S<sub>x</sub></i>, 
<i>S<sub>y</sub></i> and <i>S<sub>z</sub></i> for a spin with <i>s</i> = 1/2 can be expressed by the 
three 2 x 2 Pauli <a href="matrix.html">matrices</a>.

<p>
The diagonal elements represent the <i>&alpha;</i> and <i>&beta;</i> states. The off-diagonal elements 
are <a href="coherences.html">coherences</a>, superpositions of both states where the complex 
coefficients are in phase. 
</p>
<p>
In the case of more complex nuclei the spin is understood as the total angular momentum <i>I</i> of all 
constituent protons and neutrons, which are in turn total angular moments of fundamental particles, the 
quarks. In NMR the nuclear spin is usually referring to the ground state. It is this property that is 
responsible for the NMR signal.
