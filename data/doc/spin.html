Spin

<p>
'Spin' is a fundamental property of all matter. It results as a consequence of treating
<a href="quantum_mechanics.html">quantum mechanics</a> relativistically, as was first done in
Dirac's equation. The derivation assumes that spacetime is causal, continuous, uniform and
isotropic. In special relativity, different frames of reference can be transformed into one another
using the Lorentz transformation, which considers time <i>t</i> as an additional degree of freedom
to the three spatial coordinates <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>. It can be shown using arguments
from <a href=group_theory.html>group theory</a> that only properties
<i>s</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>z</i><sup>2</sup> - <i>c</i><sup>2</sup><i>t</i><sup>2</sup>
remain unchanged under Lorentz transformation. These are called Lorentz invariants and represent
fundamental properties like the speed of light, rest mass, number of particles or electrical charge.
There exists a further Lorentz invariant that takes a form similar to angular momentum, but involves
the transformation between a spatial coordinate and time (i.e. a special Lorentz transformation or
Lorentz boost) rather than a rotation between two spatial coordinates. This gives rise to what we
refer to as spin.

As an inherently 4-dimensional object in spacetime, spin cannot be properly represented in
3-dimensional space. However, an opservable that arises from spin is a magnetic dipole moment
<i>&mu;<sub>s</sub></i>, which historically has been attributed to an assumed rotational momentum
<i>S</i> of a particle around its own axis (hence the name <i>spin</i>). The 3-dimensional
<a href="vector_model.html">vectors</a> used to graphically represent spin in Insensitive are
therefore representing the magnetic moment and not spin itself. In contrary to a normal rotational
momentum like the orbital momentum of an electron, the spin's quantum number <i>s</i> is constant
for a class of particles and may take half integer values (1/2 in case of an electron or a proton):

Not only is the spin's absolute value quantised, but its possible orientations as well. 
<a href="quantum_mechanics.html">Quantum mechanics</a> states that the spin vector's projection on any 
axis (e.g. z-direction) can only take values between <i>s</i> and <i>-s</i> in integer steps. These 
different states are degenerate in the absence of a magnetic field but split up when a magnetic field is 
applied. This is called Zeeman splitting and is proportional to the magnetic field. The spin 
projection is defined by the projection quantum number <i>m<sub>s</sub></i>.

<p>
The cartesian components of any angular momentum do not <a href="quantum_mechanics.html">commute</a>. If 
one orientation <i>m<sub>s</sub></i> is known, the other two components are completely uncertain. 
<br>
After a magnetic field <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> (usually in <i>z</i>-direction) is applied, spins-1/2 will 
<a href="relaxation.html">relax</a> over time into one of two possible Zeeman states with 
<i>m<sub>s</sub></i> = 1/2 (<i>&alpha;</i>) or <i>m<sub>s</sub></i> = -1/2 (<i>&beta;</i>) in a Boltzmann 
distribution.

In a magnetic field the orientation quantisation forces the spins in an angle to the magnetic field 
vector. The force towards the <i>z</i>-direction causes the rotational axis of the spins to 
<a href="precession.html">precess</a> around <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> with an angular frequency 
<i>&omega;</i><sup>0</sup> determined by the spin's <a href="gyromagnetic_ratio.html">gyromagnetic 
ratio</a> <i>&gamma;</i> and the magnetic field strength <i>B</i><sub>0</sub> called the 
<a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequency</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="matrix_operators.html">operators</a> for the three spin orientations <i>S<sub>x</sub></i>, 
<i>S<sub>y</sub></i> and <i>S<sub>z</sub></i> for a spin with <i>s</i> = 1/2 can be expressed by the 
three 2 x 2 Pauli <a href="matrix.html">matrices</a>.
</p>
<center><img src="formula_spin_matrix.png" height="144" width="132"></center>
<p>
The diagonal elements represent the <i>&alpha;</i> and <i>&beta;</i> states. The off-diagonal elements 
are <a href="coherences.html">coherences</a>, superpositions of both states where the complex 
coefficients are in phase. 
</p>
<p>
In the case of more complex nuclei the spin is understood as the total angular momentum <i>I</i> of all 
constituent protons and neutrons, which are in turn total angular moments of fundamental particles, the 
quarks. In NMR the nuclear spin is usually referring to the ground state. It is this property that is 
responsible for the NMR signal.
