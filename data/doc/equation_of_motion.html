If a wave function is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian it does not change over time, except for a 
complex <a href="phase.html">phase factor</a>. If this is not the case as with a superposition state, 
where the coefficients of the linear combination change as well. The equation of motion or time-dependent 
Schr&ouml;dinger equation can be used to calculate its evolution in time.

If this first order differential equation is solved one gets an exponential factor that expresses the 
temporal evolution of a wave function.

This exponential operator looks very similar to the rotational operator given below. The Hamiltonian is 
substituted by a cartesian component of a spin angular momentum operator while the time <i>t</i> is 
substituted by an angle <i>&beta;</i>.

In any rotational motion the time of free evolution can be easily converted to an angle be applying the
formula <i>&omega;</i><sup>0</sup><i>t</i> = <i>&beta;</i> with <i>&omega;</i><sup>0</sup> being the spin's
<a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequency</a>.
The Hamiltonian of a simple spin-1/2 can be written as the spin angular momentum operator multiplied by 
<i>&omega;</i><sup>0</sup>. Thus, a temporal evolution of a nuclear spin that is not in an eigenstate of 
the current spin Hamiltonian can be described as a rotation around a fixed axis. This can be both free 
<a href="precession.html">precession</a>  as well as <a href="pulse.html">rf-pulses</a>.
</p>
<p>
The temporal evolution of the <a href="density_matrix.html">density operator</a> <i>&rho;</i>, being the 
ensemble average ket-bra product of the spin system, is described by the Liouville-von Neumann equation:

Its solution is the rotational sandwich formula

The exponential of an operator's <a href="matrix.html">matrix</a> representation can be easily calculated if 
the matrix is in its base-diagonal form, where the diagonal matrix elements are the operator's eigenvalues and 
all off-diagonal matrix elements are zero. Then the matrix exponential is simply calculated by taking the 
exponential of the eigenvalues.
