            Hilbert space is a generalisation of Euclidian space to finite or infinite number of 
            dimensions and real or complex vectors. It is employed for the mathematical description of 
            <a href="quantum_mechanics.html">quantum mechanics</a>. The description of quantum states
            as vectors in Hilbert space gives the model an algebraic structure with means to measure distances,
            lengths and angles. Furthermore, it guarantees the use of the techniques of calculus on functions
            in <i>H</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Every Hilbert space <i>H</i> has an orthonormal basis. This means that any vector <b>a</b> 
            in an <i>n</i>-dimensional Hilbert space can be constructed from <i>n</i> linear independent 
            basis vectors <b>e</b><sub><i>i</i></sub> with a normalised absolute value of 1. The basis 
            is required to be complete with no points in space missing.
            </p>
            <p>
            There exists an inner product in <i>H</i>, which associates a pair of vectors 
            <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> with a real or complex number. 
            </p>

            <p>
            The inner product is linear in its first argument and turns into its complex conjugate when 
            the argument order is reversed. The inner product of a vector <b>a</b> with itself is always 
            larger than 0 and vanishes if <b>a</b> is the null vector.
            </p>

            <p>
            A norm is defined for a Hilbert space, which allows for the measurement of a vector's length,
            the distance between points, and the angle between two vectors. Hilbert space is therefore 
            both an inner product space and a complete metric space.

            <p>
            For real numbers the inner product is the multiplication of two numbers, for complex numbers
            the inner product is the multiplication of one number <i>z</i><sub>1</sub> with the complex 
            conjugate of the second number, <i>z</i><sub>2</sub>*. In Euclidian space this 
            operation is the dot product.
            </p>

            <p>
            In Euclidian geometry the three cartesian coordiantes <b>e</b><sub><i>x</i></sub>, 
            <b>e</b><sub><i>y</i></sub> and <b>e</b><sub><i>z</i></sub> span a three dimensional 
            Hilbert space. In quantum mechanics the <i>n</i> eigenstates of a quantum mechanical system span an 
            <i>n</i>-dimensional Hilbert space, where the dimensionality of the Hilbert space is equal 
            to the number of eigenstates. <i>n</i> may be infinite. For isolated <a href="spin.html">
            spins</a> the dimensionality of the Hilbert space is finite, 2 in the case of single spins
            1/2 and 4 in the case of two <a href="coupling.html">coupled</a> spins. Interactions with 
            the surroundings, i.e. in spin <a href="relaxation.html">relaxation</a>, increases the 
            number of possible states. Relaxation is therefore often treated in a semi-classical 
            approximation.<br>
            <br>
            Each normalised basis vector corresponds to a pure eigenstate, which is fully 
            <a href="populations.html">populated</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
            If the system is in a superposition state, the vector components are the coefficients in a 
            linear combination of eigenstates. The absolute value of a vector must always be unity to 
            fulfil the requirements of quantum mechanics that the described object exists.

            <p>
            <a href="coherences.html">Coherences</a> are superpositions, in which the coherent states 
            are equally populated and running in <a href="phase.html">phase</a>. The phase factor is 
            generally a complex number.

            <p>
            The complex vector components of mixed states do not necessarily have a straightforward,
            graphical interpretation, but fulfil the eigenvalue equations for the respective cartesian
            <a href="matrix_operators.html">operators</a>.

            The metric of Hilbert space makes it possible to measure observables of the quantum 
            mechanical state, as well as the probabilities with which they are measured.

            <p><b>Liouville Space</b></p>
            <p>
            Since they work on vectors in a complex metric space, each operator has a representation as
            a square, hermitian <a href="matrix.html">matrix</a>. Operators that work on vectors in Hilbert
            space can in turn be subject to transformations. The <a href="density_matrix.html">density
            operator</a> for example, which gives the probability density for a state in an ensemble, evolves
            over time due to <a href="precession.html">precession</a>, <a href="coupling.html">coupling</a> and
            <a href="relaxation.html">relaxation</a>. Transformations of the operators of Hilbert space form
            an analogous algebra called Liouville space with superoperators working on the operators in <i>H</i>.
            The superoperators also have a matrix representation that can be found by turning the
            <i>n</i> x <i>n</i> operator matrices column-wise into a single column vector. The superoperators
            are <i>n</i><sup>2</sup> x <i>n</i><sup>2</sup> matrices. The application of a superoperator on
            an operator vector in Liouville space corresponds to a two-sided
            <a href="matrix_multiplication.html">matrix multiplication</a> in Hilbert space.
            </p>

            <p>
            The hamiltonian in Liouville space can be constructed by taking the commutator of the hamiltonian in
            Hilbert space with the identity matrix.

            Superoperators are denoted by a double hat. Vectors in Liouville space are written in analogy to
            the bra-ket notation with round brackets. The <a href="equation_of_motion.html">equation of motion</a>
            in superoperator space is called the Liouville-von Neumann equation.
