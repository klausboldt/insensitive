The Settings panel offers to change all parameters that do not directly concern the spin system, which is set 
up in the <a href="spineditor.html">Spin Network Editor</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Pulse settings</b></p>
<p>
In the pulse settings the <a href="flip_angle.html">flip angle</a> and <a href="phase.html">phase</a>
of the <a href="pulse.html">rf-pulses</a> can be set, either by entering the angles as a numerical value 
between 0 and 360&deg; or by setting the slider in intervals of 15&deg;. Alternatively to the flip angle pulse
duration, strength, and frequency can be set to manipulate the pulse bandwidth. Presets suitable for spins
that are resonant between -10 and +10 Hz can be selected by clicking "Hard", "Soft", or "Selective". To create
shaped pulses a number of standard pulse envelopes can be selected from the Shape menu. The pulse will only be
applied to the spins which are set to be resonant at the bottom of the panel, which overrules the resonance
conditions set above. Resonance can be set for single spins as well as for groups of spins of
the same spin type (I or S).
<br><br>
The "Pulse Shape" module, which can be opened from the main window's toolbar, displays the pulse envelope and
corresponding excitation profile of the selected pulse shape.
The left panel shows the pulse shape and allows to set the pulse duration &Delta;<i>t</i>, either numerically or
by changing the slider. The right panel displays the pulse's power spectrum and allows to set the pulse's
resonance frequency <i>&Omega;</i> at which the flip angle is equal to the one set in the settings. If
off-resonance effects are disabled in the preferences the <a href="fourier_transformation.html">Fourier transform</a>
of the pulse shape is used as an approximation to calculate the flip angle.

<p><b>Free evolution settings</b></p>
<p>
In this panel the spins' behaviour during free evolution can be set. "Strong coupling" activates strong 
coupling between spins of the same type. "Dipolar relaxation" activates <a href="relaxation.html">
relaxation</a> via <a href="dipolar_coupling.html">dipole-dipole couplings</a> in a system of two or more 
spins. By checking "Animation" <a href="chemical_shift.html">chemical shifts</a> and <a href="coupling.html">
scalar couplings</a> will be continuously applied to the spin system and is displayed as an animation. If 
"Relaxation with evolution" is checked, relaxation will be taken into account for free evolution, both when 
clicking the "Free Evolution" button and during animation. The delay time is the step width for which 
<a href="precession.html">precession</a>, coupling and relaxation is applied when the respective buttons 
are pressed.<br>
<br>
Relaxation is simulated either empirically by applying the relaxation constants <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and 
<i>T</i><sub>2</sub> ("Dipolar relaxation" off) or by calculating the relaxation times from the dipolar 
coupling constants and the correlation time <i>&tau;</i><sub>c</sub> ("Dipolar relaxation" on). The latter is 
necessary to simulate the <a href="noe.html">nuclear Overhauser effect</a>. <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> must be 
smaller or equal to <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>. Depending on the settings either the relaxation times or 
<i>&tau;</i><sub>c</sub> is not used for the simulation.<br>
By activating "Random jitter" Insensitive simulates dephasing through random fluctuations of the Lamor
frequency, which can be caused by diffusion and inhomogenieties of the magnetic field. The coherence
cannot be refocussed by <a href="spin_echo_sandwich.html">spin echo sandwiches</a>, because the simulation is
<a href="limitations.html">limited</a> by the density matrix approach.<br>
<br>
There are two possible ways to achieve <a href="decoupling.html">decoupling</a> in Insensitive: If
"Decoupling I-Spins/S-Spin" is checked, 180&deg; pulses with a 90&deg; phase shift to the phase set in the
pulse settings will be applied during coupling and free evolution. This constantly refocusses the selected
spin type and reverses the effects of <i>J</i>-coupling. Alternatively, a <a href="spin_lock.html">spin lock</a>
field can be applied, which works as a continuous rf-field on both spin types. In this case the precession will
happen around the axis perpendicular to the set pulse phase. In order to observe the <a href="noe.html">ROE</a>
with <i>T</i><sub>1<i>&rho;</i></sub> relaxation or <a href="solid_state_nmr.html">cross polarisation</a>
"dipolar relaxation" has to be checked as well.
</p>
    
<p><b>Gradient settings</b></p>
<p>
<a href="gradients.html">Pulsed field gradients</a> along the <i>z</i>-axis will be applied with a 
strength and duration set in this panel. The values for gradient strength may vary between +32000 and 
-32000. When enabling "Diffusion" the loss of magnetisation from dephasing due to diffuion in the gradient
field is accounted for.
</p>

<p><b>Acquisition settings</b></p>
<p>
Insensitive is able to acquire one-dimensional spectra. The FID will be recorded for the 2<sup>n</sup> 
data points spaced by the dwell time, which determines the spectral width and resolution of the spectrum. 
The "Noise level" setting simulates random noise, which is added to the spectrum. The number entered in the 
percentage of the noise compared to the signal of one uncoupled spin of type I.<br>
<br>
If "Zero filling" is activated a row of zeros will be appended to the acquired FID, effectively doubling 
the spectral resolution. Changing "Zero filling" or the number of data points will reset the spectrum 
window.<br>
<br>
Acquisition of the spectrum is started by pressing the "Acquire" button on the Spin State panel.
If "after next pulse" is checked the acquisition will be started after the next rf-pulse.
</p>

<p><b>Display setting</b></p>
<p>
From the "Vectors" popup button it can be chosen to display all observable coherences each as a single 
vector, the magnetic moments of each spin or the total angular momentum that is recorded as the 
<a href="fid.html">free induction decay</a> as one single vector for each spin type. When selecting 
"moments" pure <a href="antiphase_magnetization.html">antiphase magnetisation</a> will collapse to zero.<br>
The <a href="product_operators_formalism.html">product operators</a> can be set to be displayed either in 
cartesian or spherical operator basis.<br>
The observable "simple" <a href="single_quantum_coherence.html">single-quantum coherences</a> are marked in the
density matrix if "Colour 1st order coherences" is checked. (-1)-coherences are marked in green while 
(+1)-coherences are marked in red.<br>
"Font size" allows to display the density matrix in different sizes.
