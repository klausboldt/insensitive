            In <a href="two_dimensional_spectra.html">2D spectra</a> the frequency information in the 
            indirect dimension <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> can be coded in two possible ways, as phase or 
            amplitude modulation. The problem with phase modulated spectra as obtained from a single 2D
            acquisition is that absorption and dispersion <a href="lineshapes.html">line shapes</a> mix after
            2D <a href="fourier_transformation.html">Fourier transformation</a>, resulting in the undesirable
            phase-twist line shape with broad bases. This cannot be <a href="phase.html">phase corrected</a>.
            A work-around is to record an amplitude modulated spectrum, in which the real and imaginary part
            along the indirect dimension evolve purely as cosine and sine, respectively.
            </p>
            <p><b>States method</b></p>
            <p>
            The Ruben-States-Haberkorn method realises amplitude modulation by recording two 
            sets of data, one with the original <a href="pulse_sequences.html">pulse sequence</a> and one 
            where the preparation pulses before <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> are shifted by 90&deg;. After Fourier 
            transformation along <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> the real (or imaginary) parts of each data set are
            either sine or cosine modulated. Either pair is combined to form a new complex spectrum and
            Fourier transformed along <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> to yield pure absorption or dispersion line
            shapes. This method already implements quadrature detection in the indirect dimension, making
            <a href="phase_cycling.html">phase cycling</a> to remove peaks mirrored at the centre frequency
            obsolete. This can be easily <a href="processing_two_dimensional_spectra.html">illustrated</a>
            with Insensitive at the example of a <a href="cosyqf.html">COSY</a> spectrum.
            </p>
            <p><b>TPPI</b></p>
            <p>
            The time proportional phase incrementation or Marion-W&uuml;thrich method employs real instead
            of complex Fourier transformation and introduces frequency discrimination by shifting the 
            preparation pulse phase each time the variable evolution time <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> is 
            increased.
            </p>
            <center><img src="formula_tppi.png" style="width:100%; max-width:357px;"></center>
            <p>
            Since a phase shift <i>&phi;</i> of 90&deg; turns a cosine modulation into a sine modulation, 
            if <i>&phi;</i>(<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>) = <i>&omega;</i><sub>shift</sub><i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, the 
            whole spectrum is shifted towards higher frequencies. By setting the shift to half the 
            spectral width (90&deg; for every step of <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>) one can create a spectrum 
            with no negative frequencies and thus eliminate the mirror peaks without moving the 
            spectrometer frequency from the spectrum's centre. The so treated spectrum is amplitude 
            modulated, but in order to keep the same <a href="spectrum_resolution.html">resolution</a> as 
            the untreated spectrum one must acquire twice the amount of data points by doubling the number 
            of scans, with half the step size (dwell time) in the indirect time domain. This effectively 
            doubles the amount of data and leaves half of the acquired spectrum empty to be discarded. 
            Insensitive automatically adjusts these parameters when <a href="manual.html">selecting</a> 
            TPPI as the detection method.
            </p>
            <p><b>States-TPPI</b></p>
            <p>
            Both methods above lead to pure absorption line shapes and emulate quadrature detection in the
            indirect time domain. Still, strong artefacts appear at the centre of the <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>
            coordinate, which result from exitation of spins that have relaxed during the variable delay
            time. To get rid of these two phase cycles can be employed with a phase shift of 180&deg; for all
            pulses before <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> as well as the receiver. The phase shift reverses only the
            phase of the unwanted signals, which cancel out between the two runs.<br>
            <br>
            The same results are reached by running an experiment using the States method, but shifting
            the phases of all pulses before <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> and the receiver by 180&deg; every
            step of <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, or twice the value employed for TPPI. After complex Fourier
            transformation only the artefacts are shifted out of the relevant spectral range. No
            extra phase cycling is needed, but the number of data points has to be doubled to retain
            spectral resolution.
