Coherences
</h1>

<p>
Coherences are superpositions of two or more eigenstates in a <a href="quantum_mechanics.html">quantum 
mechanical</a> system. They represent a state where two eigenstates are not only equally 
<a href="populations.html">populated</a> (this would lead to zero magnetisation) but also have the same 
complex <a href="phase.html">phase factor</a>. The complex plane of this phase factor can be viewed as 
the x,y-plane perpendicular to the direction of the external magnetic field. The complex coherence results
in a transverse magnetisation.

<p>
The coherence order is the number of spins of synchronous phase. A population is independent from the 
spins' phase and is therefore of the order 0. <a href="single_quantum_coherence.html">Single-quantum 
coherences</a> of the order 1 are an ensemble of spins, all with the same phase. 
<a href="antiphase_magnetization.html">Antiphase magnetisation</a> also has the coherence order 1. Instead
of being one set of spins with the same phase and finite magnetisation the antiphase terms represent 
coherences relative to another spin's population. <a href="multi_quantum_coherence.html">Higher order 
coherences</a> with the coherence order 2, 3, ... are states of two or more coupled spins in which the 
spins have a fixed phase relative to each other, but no net magnetisation in the ensemble average. In the 
case of <op>2I1xI2y</op> the two spins have a fixed angle of 90&deg; in the x,y-plane, but point 
either along <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> or -<i>x</i>  and -<i>y</i> with the same probability.

<p>
In a <a href="density_matrix.html">density matrix</a> coherences are represented by the off-diagonal 
<a href="matrix.html">matrix</a> elements. Coherences can be positive or negative. The two possible coherences 
+ and - are represented as complex conjugate matrix elements that are mirrored at the matrix diagonal. They can
be geometrically interpreted as clockwise and counterclockwise rotations around <op>Iz</op>. 
</p>
<p>
An easy way to get the coherence orders of a given spin state is to analyse the 
<a href="product_operator_formalism.html">product operators</a> in the <a href="spherical_tensors.html">
spherical tensor basis</a>. Changes in the coherence order of &plusmn;1 are mathematically described 
through the shift <a href="matrix_operators.html">operators</a> <op>I<sup>+</sup></op> and 
<op>I<sup>-</sup></op>.
