                Recording a Pulse Sequence
            </h1>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <p>
            NMR experiments are performed by applying a sequence of <a href="pulses.html">rf-pulses</a> to the
            spin system, separated by time delays and ending with acquisition of the <a href="fid.html">free
            induction decay</a>. This can be
            done manually in Insensitive using the <a href="spin_manipulation.html">Spin State</a> panel.
            Alternatively pulse sequences can be recorded and then applied to a spin system in a single step. The
            Pulse Sequence panel handles recording, display, editing, and running of pulse sequences.
            </p>
            <p>
            Pulses are displayed as red squares (or different shapes for shaped pulses) with an indexed phase &phi;.
            Pulses field gradients are shown as green lobes. Decoupling sequences are indicated by wide, light red
            bars, while data acquisition is symbolised by a decaying sine wave. Delay times &tau; are also numbered
            and labelled.
            </p>

            <p>
            Click "Record" to start recording pulses, evolution times and gradients applied to the spin system.
            This will automatically switch to the Spin State panel and the recorded pulse sequence will appear in
            a separate window. During recording the separate application of chemical shifts and coupling is disabled.
            Recording is stopped by either clicking "Stop" or by starting acquisition of a spectrum, which ends
            a pulse sequence. The previous pulse sequence is deleted when recording is started again and unsaved
            sequences are discarded. The complete sequence can be applied to the spin system by clicking the "Play"
            button. If the pulse sequence ends with acquisition the display will automatically change to the
            <a href="spectrum.html">Spectrum</a> panel and a spectrum is displayed. If no FID is recorded the pulse
            sequence is simply applied to the spin system in its current state (no phase cycling is used) and the
            resulting spin state will be displayed in the Spin State panel.<br>
            When holding the ALT key when clicking "Play" the pulse sequence can be executed step-wise. For this only
            the first row of the phase cycling table is used and t<sub>1</sub> of a 2D sequence is not incremented.
            Insensitive will switch to the Spin State panel and the pulse sequence is shown in a separate window.
            The current position in the pulse sequence is shown by a yellow diamond. Further steps can be applied by
            clicking the button with the footprint icon. The resulting spectrum acquired at the end of step-wise
            execution is always a 1D spectrum.
            </p>
            <p><b>Editing pulse sequences</b></p>
            <p>
            Once a pulse sequence has been recorded it can be edited by clicking on pulses, delays or gradients.
            The element to be edited is then marked in yellow and the actions bar at the top of the window changes
            to a text field and a menu to select the property to be changed. For pulses the pulse shape, flip angle,
            pulse duration and strength, the resonance frequency, and whether decoupling sequences are applied on
            other channels can be changed. For gradients duration and strength can be edited, while for evolution
            periods the delay time and decoupling sequences can be changed. For the FID the detection channel and
            decoupling during detection can be edited. The values is changed in the pulse sequence when pressing
            enter or clicking "OK"
            </p>
            <p><b>2D Spectra</b></p>
            <p>
            <a href="two_dimensional_spectra.html">2D spectra</a> require a second time variable, which is
            systematically incremented to acquire arrayed spectra. This variable evolution time can be selected
            from the menu labelled "t<sub>1</sub> =", which includes a list of all evolutions times
            &tau;<sub><i>i</i></sub> in the pulse sequence, as well as every pair of delays
            &tau;<sub><i>i</i></sub> + &tau;<sub><i>j</i></sub> of equal duration before and after a pulse. A 1D
            spectrum is acquired if t<sub>1</sub> is set to FID, otherwise Insensitive will automatically acquire an
            arrayed 2D spectrum. The incremented evolution time is marked in blue in the pulse sequence.
            </p>
            <p><b>Phase cycling table</b></p>
            <p>
            The table below the pulse sequence allows to set the required <a href="phase_cycling.html">phase cycles</a>.
            Phases can be entered as absolute angles or in modulo 90 notation (0 &equiv; 0&deg;, 1 &equiv; 90&deg;,
            2 &equiv; 180&deg;, 3 &equiv; 270&deg;). A column for each pulse and the receiver phase of the detector
            is shown. The number of phase cycles can be entered in the text field in the action bar at the top of
            the window.<br>
            <br>
            By selecting "Coherence Transfer Pathway" from the menu at the right hand side of the action bar the
            phase cycling table can be changed to a diagram of the <a href="coherence_pathways.html">coherence
            transfer pathways</a> for the current pulse sequence and spin system. This operation requires
            (2<i>n</i>+1)<sup><i>p</i></sup> computational cycles for <i>n</i> spins and <i>p</i> pulses and may take
            a lot of time. The cut off value for the maximum number of computed steps can be set in the pereferences.
            </p>
            <p><b>Pure phase spectra</b></p>
            <p>
            In order to acquire 2D spectra with pure absorption line shape and <a href="pure_phase_spectra.html">
            amplitude modulation</a> one of several standard acquisition methods can be selected from the
            "Modulation" menu: "States", "TPPI", and "States-TPPI". These methods acquire twice the amount of data
            (four times in the case of States-TPPI), which will be reflected in the acquisition time. Acquiring 2D
            spectra takes a lot of time. The simulation time can be reduced if computation-intensive options are
            disabled, e.g. strong coupling or dipolar relaxation, or if the number of data points is reduced.
            </p>
            <p><b>Saving pulse sequences</b></p>
            <p>
            Pulse Sequences can be opened and saved as Insensitive Pulse Program (*.ipp) files using the "File" menu.
            By selecting "Pulse Program Code" from the menu at the right hand side of the action bar the recorded
            pulse sequence can be translated into code for Bruker spectrometers. This is only possible if the
            pulse sequence closes with spectrum acquisition. The text file can be exported from the "File" menu and
            is intended purely for educational purposes. It may be incomplete or contain errors. Do not use it on a
            real spectrometer without checking the code with an experienced and authorised person. The author takes
            absolutely no warranty for damaged equipment!
