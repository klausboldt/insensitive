            After <a href="fourier_transformation.html">Fourier transformation</a> of the 
            <a href="fid.html">FID</a> a number of artefacts may occur in the spectrum, which are caused 
            by the finite acquisition time. Steps in the signal, which can be described as an overlaying 
            rectangular function, cause strong oscillations of the sinc-function, which are 
            <a href="convolution_theorem.html">convoluted</a> with the spectral peaks. This phenomenon 
            is typically observed when the resolution of the spectrum is enhanced by adding trailing
            zeros to an FID that has not dropped to zero at the end of the acquisition.
            </p>
            <p>
            A linear transformation of the data by multiplying the FID with an apodization or window 
            function can remove the artefacts. The goal is to decrease the signal to zero at the end of 
            the acquisition time. Since this procedure reduces the signal intensity this is always a 
            trade-off between narrower signal shapes and decreased signal-to-noise ratio.
            </p>
            <p>
            Several functions are in use. The simplest method is multiplication by an exponential decay, 
            which has the disadvantage of causing very strong line broadening. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Other common apodization functions, which show less pronounced line broadening, are the 
            cosine function over a quarter period
            </p>

            <p>
            a triangle function, which decreases the FID linearly with time,
            </p>

            <p>
            and the Hann function.
            </p>
            <center><img src="formula_window_hann.png" height="39" width="192"></center>
            <p>
            Apart from removing artefacts the application of window functions is used as a tool for line 
            narrowing. Contrary to the cases above this causes a decrease of the signal-to-noise ratio,
            because for narrower lines the low signal range at long acquisition times must be overestimated.
            A simple window function is the sine bell function.
            </p>

            <p>
            This function causes narrow lines with strong oscillations and disappearing integrals. An 
            alternative is the Hann function weighted by an exponential function. This window function also
            causes narrowing of the spectral lines at the expense of signal-to-noise ratio.

            The "Transform of Reverse Added FIDs" or TRAF function published by D. D. Traficante is a function that
            increases either resolution or signal-to-noise ratio without degradation of the other. This is
            accomplished by deemphasising the noisy part of the FID where most of the signal has decayed, and
            employing a "matched filter" approach in which the signal is convoluted with a time-reversed, complex
            conjugated general shape of the FID. This is equivalent to scaling of each point of the FID
            by the amount of signal present at that point. The function is:

            with
            </p>
            <center><img src="formula_window_traf_E.png" height="18" width="86"></center>
            <p>
            and
            </p>

            <p>
            <i>T</i> is the total acquisition time. The TRAF window requires knowledge of the effective
            transverse relaxation time <i>T</i><sub>2</sub><sup>&ast;</sup>.<br>
            <br>
            A conversion of the lines into gaussian functions is performed by a Lorentz-Gauss transformation.
            </p>
            <center><img src="formula_lorentz_gauss.png" height="31" width="121"></center>
            <p>
            Here the signal is deconvoluted by a Lorentz function with the signal's peak width determined 
            by <i>T</i><sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> and then convoluted with a Gauss function of arbitrary 
            width 1.177<i>&sigma;</i>. The advantage of this is that a Gauss peak has a smaller tail than 
            a Lorentz peak, which causes better separation of spectral lines, while at the same time 
            adding apodization to the FID.
            </p>
            <p>
            While reducing the peak's tail a 2D gaussian <a href="lineshapes.html">line shape</a> still has a
            star-shaped cross section. It can be transformed into cylindrical symmetry by means of the pseudo-echo transformation.
            </p>
            <center><img src="formula_pseudoecho.png" height="35" width="170"></center>
            <p>
            As with the Lorentz-Gauss transformation the signal is deconvoluted to remove the instrument decay.
            It is then multiplied with a signal envelope that is symmetric around the centre of the FID,
            giving it the appearance of a <a href="cpmg.html">spin echo</a>. The symmetrical cosine components
            of this signal will give rise to pure absorption line shapes, while sine components that would cause
            dispersion lines are antisymmetrical and vanish if the absolute value spectrum is calculated, as well
            as a complex phase factor exp(<i>i&phi;</i>) that is carried over from the phase-sensitive signal.<br>
            The clean elliptical or cylindrical symmetry of the signals after pseudo-echo transformation comes
            at the cost of significantly reduced signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity, because the high
            intensities for small times <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> are strongy reduced.
