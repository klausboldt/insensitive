Product operator formalism
</h1>
</div>

<div>
<p>
The product operator formalism takes the <a href="density_matrix.html">density matrix</a> representation 
of a spin system to an easily readable form by writing it as a sum of orthogonal matrices, each 
represented as an <a href="matrix_operators.html">operator</a> independent of the spin system's size. A 
product operator representing the z-component of the second spin in a system (or the 
<a href="populations.html">population</a> of the <i>&alpha;</i>-state) would be <op>I2z</op>, the 
x-component (or <a href="coherences.html">coherence</a> in x-direction) of spin 1 would be <op>I1x</op>. 
Coupling between spins can be described by a <a href="matrix_multiplication.html">product</a> of two 
states, indicating a linked state. <op>2I1xI2z</op> indicates a state where the x-component of spin 1 is 
linked to a populated <i>&alpha;</i>-state of spin 2, while a spin 1 in -x-direction would be linked to a 
populated <i>&beta;</i>-state of spin 2. Any product operator can be combined with any number of product 
operators for other spins in the ensemble, e.g. <op>4I1zI2xI3x</op>. The leading coefficient is needed to 
make the trace of the density matrix equal to 1.
</p>
<p>
The usefulness of the product operator formalism arises from the fact that in this form states (e.g. a spin 
along the x-axis) and a rotational operation (e.g. a rotation around the x-axis) takes the same form. 
Thus, precession and rf-pulses can be described by <a href="group_theory.html">group theory</a> by applying a 
product operator (rotation) to another product operator (state), resulting in a changed state.

<p>
Precession is a rotation around the z-axis or an <op>Iz</op> operator applied to a mixture of <op>Ix</op> 
and <op>Iy</op> states.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="pulse.html">pulse</a> is a rotation around the x(y)-axis or an <op>Ix</op> (<op>Iy</op>) 
operator applied to an <op>Iz</op> state.
</p>
<p>
Coupling is the linked precession of two or more spins <op>I1x</op>, <op>I2x</op> by the 
<a href="longitudinal_two_spin_order.html">longitudinal two-spin order</a> <op>2I1zI2z</op> and results 
in antiphase magnetisation <op>2I1yI2z</op> and <op>2I1zI2y</op>.
</p>
<p>
The more sensitive spins are denominated by <op>I</op> while the less sensitive spin type (usually the
hetero nuclei) is denominated by <op>S</op>.
</p>
<p>
An alternative to the cartesian product operator basis are the <a href="spherical_tensors.html">spherical 
tensor operators</a> and the <a href="singlet_triplet_basis.html">singlet-triplet basis</a>.
