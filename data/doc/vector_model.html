<a href="spin.html">Spin</a> was first derived from the magnetic moment inherent to charged elementary 
particles, caused by an intrinsic rotational momentum. It is usually pictured as the normal vector 
perpendicular to the plane of rotation, following the right hand rule. To measure such a magnetic moment 
the system has to be brought into an external magnetic field <b>B</b><sub>0</sub>, which as a convention
defines the <i>z</i>-axis of the coordinate system. For isolated spins the behaviour of their magnetic
moments as a function of time (including <a href="relaxation.html">relaxation</a>) is described by the 
Bloch equations:

<p>
The <a href="gyromagnetic_ratio.html">gyromagnetic ratio</a> <i>&gamma;</i> is the proportionality factor
between the magnetic moment and spin. As a result of <a href="quantum_mechanics.html">quantum mechanics</a>
there exist two possible orientations of a spin 1/2 to the external field, <i>&alpha;</i> and
<i>&beta;</i>, with a slight <a href="energy_levels.html">energy difference</a>. In thermal equilibrium 
that leads to a small excess of spins <a href="populations.html">populating</a> the <i>&alpha;</i>-state, 
following the Boltzman distribution.  
</p>

<p>
It is this excess magnetisation that gives rise to the weak signal in the NMR experiment.<br> Also as a 
consequence from quantum mechanics the magnetic moments cannot align perfectly with the external field, 
which causes the normal vectors to <a href="precession.html">precess</a> around the <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> 
axis on the surface of a cone, either parallel or antiparallel to the <i>z</i>-axis. Its 
<a href="larmor_frequency.html">angular frequency</a> is determined by the difference of the two energy 
levels.<br> The NMR experiment is always measured in a large ensemble of spins. Most of them cancel out, the 
excess magnetisation of spins distributed equally around the cone's surface gives rise to a magnetisation 
vector parallel to the +<i>z</i>-axis, while the orientation in <i>x</i>- or <i>y</i>-direction is random 
and averages to zero. This is the signal displayed in Insensitive. The <a href="single_spins.html">Single
Spins</a> module allows to visualise the trajectory of individual spins.

<p>
Following from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, if the orientation of a spin along one axis 
is known, the other two cartesian components become completely indeterminable. This happens for 
example by applying the field <b>B</b><sub>0</sub>. This means that if a single spin's 
<i>z</i>-magnetisation is determined to be either +1/2 or -1/2 one will measure either one of these values 
for the <i>x</i>- or <i>y</i>-component with equal probability. A <a href="pulse.html">pulse</a> of 
radio frequency irradiation can rotate the average magnetisation by providing another principal axis the 
spins precess around. A 90&deg;<sub>x</sub> pulse from the <i>x</i>-direction rotates the spins around the 
axis of incidence for 90&deg;, resulting in an average magnetisation along -<i>y</i>. After the 
pulse has ended and the field is again dominated by <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> the system has equally populated 
<i>&alpha;</i> and <i>&beta;</i> levels, but a finite probability of any single spin vector rotating in 
<a href="phase.html">phase</a> with the others. This is called <a href="coherences.html">coherence</a>.
Only magnetisation in the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i>-plane can be detected.
</p>
<p>
Each kind of spin, depending on its <a href="chemical_shift.html">chemial shift</a> and the state of the 
spins it <a href="coupling.html">couples</a> with, give rise to one vector in Insensitive's vector model.
It can be <a href="settings.html">chosen</a> between three display modes, either as individual spins, as 
expectation values of magnetisation, where <a href="antiphase_magnetization.html">antiphase terms</a>
collapse to zero, and as the total average magnetisation seen by the detector.
</p>
<p>
Of all representations in this application the vector model has the largest restrictions, but it has its 
advantages because of the intuitive geometric interpretation of spin states (or magnetic moments) as 
vectors.  The limits of the vector model are reached when <a href="coherence_transfer.html">coherence 
transfer</a> takes place. This transfer of magnetisation between two coupled spins involves states that 
have no net magnetisation. They only describe the orientation of spins in relation to other spins in a 
coupled system and not to the external magnetic field. Still they are crucial in explaining most 
two-dimensional experiments like the <a href="cosyqf.html">H,H-COSY</a>. Note that Insensitive only 
simulates the spin ensemble, never the single spins pictured above!
