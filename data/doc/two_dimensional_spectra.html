Two-dimensional spectra are acquired by repeating the <a href="pulse_sequences.html">pulse sequence</a> of the 
experiment and recording the <a href="fid.html">FID</a>, while an evolution time <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> after the 
initial preparation period is systematically varied. 
</p>
<center><img src="pp_2D_experiment.png" height="99" width="429"></center>
<p>
<i>t</i><sub>1</sub> is called the indirect time domain and introduces a <a href="phase.html">phase shift</a> 
between the consecutive FIDs. A mixing period follows, in which <a href="coherence_transfer.html">coherence 
transfer</a> between spins takes place. The time variable for the free induction decay is called the direct 
time domain <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>. The time-domain spectra can be plotted as follows.

<p>
To process the data, the <a href="fourier_transformation.html">Fourier transformation</a> of each of the FIDs 
must be calculated. This results in a row of spectra in the direct frequency domain <i>F</i><sub>2</sub> with a 
systematic variation of the phase, as mentioned above. The signal intensity becomes weaker with longer 
<i>t</i><sub>1</sub> times.

<p>
A Fourier transformation of the signals with equal <a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequency</a> as a 
function of <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> results in a spectrum in the indirect frequency domain <i>F</i><sub>1</sub>. 
For computational reasons the resolution of the <i>F</i><sub>1</sub>-domain is usually lower than for the
directly observed <i>F</i><sub>2</sub>-domain.
</p>
<center><img src="img_FFT2D_FF.png" style="width:100%; max-width:600px;"></center>
<p>
The frequency at which the peak appears in the <i>F</i><sub>2</sub>-domain depends on the spin's Larmor 
frequency in the <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>-domain, while the frequency in the <i>F</i><sub>1</sub>-domain depends on 
the frequency of the magnetisation during the delay <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>.
</p>
<p>
There exist two classes of two-dimensional spectra. In correlated spectra like the <a href="cosyqf.html">
COSY</a>-experiment the spectrum shows cross peaks between correlated spins, if the magnetisation evolves 
with the <a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequency</a> of one spin during <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> and 
with the Larmor frequency of a second spin after the mixing period during <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>. Contrary 
to this, resolved spectra display two independent aspects of a spectrum along the two dimensions. 
<a href="j_resolved.html"><i>J</i>-Resolved</a> spectra for example separate the spin 
<a href="coupling.html">coupling</a> from their <a href="chemical_shift.html">chemical shifts</a> and 
facilitate <a href="spectrum_resolution.html">resolving</a> overlapping multiplets.
</p>
<p>
The Fourier transformation of the indirect time domain cannot discriminate between clockwise and 
counterclockwise precession as the direct time domain with quadrature detection. This causes the 2D 
spectrum to be mirrored at the centre frequency. The mirrored signals can be removed by 
<a href="phase_cycling.html">phase cycling</a>, <a href="gradients.html">pulsed field gradients</a>
or taking <a href="pure_phase_spectra.html">amplitude modulated</a> spectra. All steps of the 
<a href="processing_two_dimensional_spectra.html">processing</a> can be simulated in Insensitive.
