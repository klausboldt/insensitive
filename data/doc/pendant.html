            The PENDANT experiment (Polarisation ENhancement During Attached Nucleus Testing) is 
            comparable to the <a href="dept.html">DEPT</a> experiment, but shows all possible carbon atoms 
            in a molecule, including those not bound to any hydrogen, with phases depending on the number 
            of <a href="coupling.html">coupled</a> hydrogen atoms. Primary and tertiary carbon atoms cause 
            signals pointing upwards, while signals of secondary and quarternary carbon atoms point 
            downwards.

            <p>
            The PENDANT is very similar to the refocussed <a href="ineptnd.html">INEPT</a> sequence, but starts 
            with a pulse on the carbon atoms (<i>S</i> spins) as well as on the protons (<i>I</i> spins).
            This causes magnetisation of the quarternary carbon atoms to be visible, albeit with less 
            intensity than for other configurations. The intensity values are therefore not comparable.
