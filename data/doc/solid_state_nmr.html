Solid state NMR

<p>
When measuring powdered solids with NMR one has to consider several effects that average out in solution 
NMR due to Brownian motion. The main effects in solid state NMR are <a href="dipolar_coupling.html">
dipole-dipole coupling</a>, which is the major contribution to the coupling Hamiltonian, 
<a href="chemical_shift.html">chemical shift anisotropies</a> and a much longer <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and 
shorter <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> <a href="relaxation.html">relaxation</a> time compared to solutions.
</p>
<p>
The strong chemical shift anisotropy results in typical powder patterns, broad signals with sharply 
defined edges at high and low frequencies. They result from a distribution of different orientations of 
crystallites in the sample.

Compared with solution NMR the <a href="coupling.html"><i>J</i>-coupling</a> plays a small role in solid 
state NMR compared to the <a href="dipolar_coupling.html">dipole-dipole coupling</a>. Dipolar interactions
do not average out in crystalline samples, and as with the chemical shift anisotropy the orientation 
dependence results in broad line shapes called <i>Pake patterns</i>.

The signal broadening can be removed by spinning the sample at an angle of 54.7&deg; to the axis of the 
<b>B</b><sub>0</sub>-field (Magic Angle Spinning, MAS). At this specific angle the term 
3 cos<sup>2</sup><i>&theta;</i> - 1 that describes the orientation dependence of dipolar coupling and 
chemical shift anisotropy becomes 0 and the signal collapses to a single line. A lower spinning frequency 
than the width of the powder pattern leads to spinning sidebands, sharp lines that are separated from the 
isotropic chemical shift by multiples of the spinning frequency.
