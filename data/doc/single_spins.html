            The <a href="density_matrix.html">density matrix</a> description of NMR is limited to describe the behaviour of a spin ensemble
            and yields the expectation value for the magnetisation that is obtained after the measurement of a large number spins.
            This <a href="limitations.html">limits</a> the visualisation capabilities of the program in the case of dephasing, or simply
            for understanding how the behaviour of individual spins leads to the macroscopic result of the NMR experiment. Therefore,
            the trajectories of individuals spins is shown in the "Single Spins" module.

            The most important principle to describe single spins under the influence of external magentic fields is that only one
            cartesian component of angular momentum can be measured with certainty: if the <i>z</i> component is known through a measurement
            to be either up or down (&alpha; or &beta; state), the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components are completely undetermined.
            The relationship between the three cartesian components is expressed through a cyclic commutation rule:
            </p>
            <center><img src="formula_cyclic_commutation.png" width="131" height="23"></center>
            <p>
            As one of two components becomes more determined (e.g. <op>Ix</op>) it converts the certainty of the second component
            (e.g. <op>Iz</op>) into certainty of the third one (<op>Iy</op>). This is equal to a rotation around (in this example)
            the <i>x</i> axis as a result of the rf-pulse from <i>x</i>-direction.
            </p>
            <p>
            Physically, the presence of a rotating <b>B</b><sub>1</sub> field perpendicular to the principal <i>z</i> axis tilts the
            axis of the total magentic field <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> + <b>B</b><sub>1</sub> slightly in a time-dependent manner. (The tilt
            angle, as well as the relative <a href="precession.html">precession</a> frequencies around the <i>z</i> and <i>x</i> axes, are
            exaggerated for didactic reasons.) This time-dependent perturbation puts the system in a perpetual non-equilibrium state.
            The small <b>B</b><sub>1</sub> field of the <a href="pulse.html">rf-pulse</a> in <i>x</i> direction converts <i>z</i>
            magnetisation into -<i>y</i> magnetisation. However, the rotation of the circularly polarised radiofrequency never allows the
            spins to <a href="relaxation.html">relax</a> into the new equilibrium. The oscillating tilt of the magnetic field leads to a
            movement of the total angular momentum of the spin ensemble to follow a spiralling path, called <i>nutation</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Viewed from the perspective of the <a href="rotating_frame.html">rotating frame</a>, the resonant spins no longer precess
            around the <i>z</i> axis. However, despite the apparent disappearance of the <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> field, the non-equilibrium
            persists, yielding a continuous rotating of the spin states around the <i>x</i> axis, turning <i>z</i> magnetisation into
            -<i>y</i> into -<i>z</i> into <i>y</i> and back into <i>z</i> magnetisation. Once the rf-field is switched off the spins that
            are oriented in <i>y</i> direction are in a superposition state of both &alpha; and &beta; with respect to the static
            <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> field.
            </p>
            <p>
            With no pulse acting on the spins, <a href="relaxation.html">relaxation</a> returns the spins into the state of thermal
            equilibrium. Longitudinal (<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>) relaxation flips spins from the &beta; to the &alpha; state until ratio
            between the occupied states follows the Boltzmann distribution. Transversal (<i>T</i><sub>2</sub>) relaxation causes
            dephasing and loss of <a href="coherences.html">coherence</a> of the individual spins around the <i>z</i> axis.
            (Note that the difference between the occupation of the &alpha; and &beta; state is strongly exaggerated. In reality, the
            difference in occupation probability is 8 x 10<sup>-5</sup> for protons at 300 K, using a 500 MHz spectrometer.)
            </p>
            <p>
            The single spin precession is simulated through uncoupled spins, which are exactly on resonance with the rf pulse, i.e.
            <i>&Omega;</i><sup>0</sup> = 0 Hz. Insensitive can simulate three different conditions: in the presence of a static
            <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> field, during the application of the <b>B</b><sub>1</sub> field of the rf pulse, and in the absence
            of any field. In addition, the spin states can be shown in the static or <a href="rotating_frame.html">rotating frame</a>.
            In the absence of any magnetic field Insensitive displays the spin states of up to 100 random spins as
            <a href="vector_model.html">vectors</a> starting at the origin. These states cannot be observed directly in an experiment.
            For a measurement an external magnatic field needs to be applied, which determines the principal axis, which is usually the
            <i>z</i> axis for <b>B</b><sub>0</sub>. The measurement determines one of the cartesian components of the angular momentum.
            Hence, the other two components are completely uncertain. This results in a random distribution of the vectors in the <i>x</i>
            and <i>y</i> directions, and one of two possible orientations in <i>z</i> direction, leading to a double cone. The indeterminancy
            of the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components are visualised through the large number of vectors. In reality, if the state of a spin
            is known, either &alpha; pointing in +<i>z</i> direction or &beta; pointing in -<i>z</i> direction, its <i>x</i> or <i>y</i>
            component cannot actually be drawn. A visualisation that would describe the state better would be a cone that is completely
            shaded in the colour used for the vector.
