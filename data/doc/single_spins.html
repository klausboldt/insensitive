            For spin, like all <a href="quantum_mechanics.html">quantum mechanical</a> angular momentum, the Uncertainly
            Principle dictates that only the absolute square <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> of the angular momentum and one of the
            cartesian components <i>s</i><sub>z</sub> can be known at the same time, while the other components
            <i>s</i><sub>x</sub> and <i>s</i><sub>y</sub> are completely unknown. This has led to the common depiction of
            spin as "double cones" that point either upwards or downwards along the principal axis (<i>z</i> in this example),
            on the surface of which the orthogonal spin components are smeared out and <a href="precession.html">precess</a>.
            Drawing single spins as classical vectors is, hence, not possible.

            The <a href="density_matrix.html">density matrix</a> description of NMR and all its derived models in
            Insensitive like the <a href="vector_model.html">vector model</a> are based on statistical quantum mechanics.
            It averages over a spin ensemble and yields the expectation value for the magnetisation that is obtained after
            the measurement of a large number spins. This <a href="limitations.html">limits</a> the visualisation capabilities
            of the program in the case of dephasing, or simply for understanding how the behaviour of individual spins leads
            to the macroscopic result of the NMR experiment. Therefore, the trajectories of individual spins is shown in the
            "Single Spins" module.

            The uncertainty of the cartesian components of spin in an external magnetic field is expressed through a cyclic
            commutation relation
            </p>
            <center><img src="formula_cyclic_commutation.png" width="131" height="23"></center>
            <p>
            In an external magnetic field <b>B</b><sub>0</sub>, if the <i>z</i> component is known through a measurement to
            be either up or down (&alpha; or &beta; state), the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components are completely undetermined
            and the vector is smeared out over the whole cone. If, instead, the <i>x</i> component is known, the cyclic
            commutation rule under the influence of the <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> in <i>z</i> direction converts the certainty
            of the <i>x</i> component into certainty along the -<i>y</i> direction, then into -<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> in a
            cyclic manner. Physically, this is equal to precession around the <i>z</i> axis.
            </p>
            <p>
            A linear polarised <a href="pulse.html">rf-pulse</a> with strength 2<b>B</b><sub>1</sub> cos(<i>&omega;t</i>)
            perturbs the <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> field. Linear polarised radiation can be split in two circular polarised beams
            with opposite direction. Of these beams, one rotates opposite to the precession of the spins and, hence, can be
            neglected for being off-resonance. The other has a magnetic field component <b>B</b><sub>1</sub> that varies
            periodically from <i>x</i> to -<i>y</i> to -<i>x</i> to <i>y</i> back to <i>x</i>, following the polarisation
            vector. That tilts the principal axis of the system is slightly away from <i>z</i> to align with the periodically
            changing total magentic field <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> + <b>B</b><sub>1</sub>. (The tilt angle, as well as the relative
            <a href="precession.html">precession</a> frequencies around the <i>z</i> and <i>x</i> axes, are exaggerated for
            didactic reasons.) This time-dependent perturbation puts the system in a perpetual non-equilibrium state in which
            the spins never <a href="relaxation.html">relax</a> into a new equilibrium and the uncetainty shifts between the
            cartesian components. The oscillating tilt of the magnetic field leads to a movement of the total angular momentum
            of the spin ensemble to follow a spiralling path, called <i>nutation</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
            Viewed from the perspective of the <a href="rotating_frame.html">rotating frame</a>, the resonant spins no longer
            precess around the <i>z</i> axis, because the effect of the dominating field along <i>z</i> is mathematically
            removed. However, despite the apparent disappearance of the <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> field, the non-equilibrium
            persists, yielding a continuous rotating of the spin states around the <i>x</i> axis, which
            turns <i>z</i> magnetisation into -<i>y</i> into -<i>z</i> into <i>y</i> and back into <i>z</i> magnetisation.
            Once the rf-field is switched off the spins that are oriented in <i>y</i> direction are in a superposition state
            of both &alpha; and &beta; with respect to the static <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> field.
            </p>
            <p>
            With no pulse acting on the spins, <a href="relaxation.html">relaxation</a> returns the spins into the state of
            thermal equilibrium. Longitudinal (<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>) relaxation flips spins from the &beta; to the &alpha; state
            until the ratio between the occupied states follows the Boltzmann distribution. Transversal (<i>T</i><sub>2</sub>)
            relaxation causes dephasing and loss of <a href="coherences.html">coherence</a> of the individual spins around the
            <i>z</i> axis. (Note that the difference between the occupation of the &alpha; and &beta; state is strongly
            exaggerated. In reality, the difference in occupation probability is 8 x 10<sup>-5</sup> for protons at 300 K, using
            a 500 MHz spectrometer.)
            </p>
            <p>
            The single spin precession is simulated through uncoupled spins, which are exactly on resonance with the rf pulse,
            i.e. <i>&Omega;</i><sup>0</sup> = 0 Hz. Insensitive can simulate three different conditions: in the presence of a
            static <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> field, during the application of the <b>B</b><sub>1</sub> field of the rf pulse, and in
            the absence of any field. In addition, the spin states can be shown in the static or
            <a href="rotating_frame.html">rotating frame</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Insensitive either calculates the uncertainty of a single spin and depicts it as colour shading of the cones if the
            slider for the number of spins is moves to the right, or simulates between 1 and 1000 individual spins.
            In the absence of any magnetic field Insensitive displays the spins as vectors pointing from the origin. It is
            important to note that these states cannot be observed directly in an experiment and represent a hypothetical
            snapshot of the spin ensemble.
            For a measurement an external magnatic field needs to be applied, which determines the principal axis, usually
            denoted with <i>z</i> for the <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> field. The measurement determines one of the cartesian components
            of the angular momentum. The uncertainty of the other components is shown as fluctuations of the individual
            vectors and results in a random distribution in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Single Spin module of Insensitive needs to be treated as an illustration of the breakdown of the vector model
            for spin rather than a depiction of reality.
