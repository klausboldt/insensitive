The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment makes use of the magnetic moment associated
with the <a href="spin.html">spin</a> of atomic nuclei to gain information on the
<a href="pople_notation.html">chemical structure</a> of molecules and solids. Understanding
the physics behind spin dynamics can be challenging. Insensitive is an application that helps
with that by visualising the NMR experiment on the level of a spin ensemble. The spin system
is represented as a semiclassical <a href="vector_model.html">vector model</a>, as a spin
<a href="density_matrix.html">density matrix</a> and as a sum of
<a href="product_operator_formalism.html">product operators</a>. Additionally the 
<a href="energy_levels.html">energy level</a> diagram of the spin system can be displayed.

Read the <a href="manual.html">user's manual</a> for instructions to use Insensitive. The 
spectrometer hardware is explained <a href="spectrometer.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Quantum mechanics</b></p>
<p>
It is important to understand that <a href="spin.html">spin</a> is an inherently
<a href="quantum_mechanics.html">quantum mechanical</a> property that has no equivalent in
the macroscopic world. Every visualisation in three-dimensional space is bound to fail at
some point and carries the danger of misunderstanding the concept of spin as orbital
momentum in 3 dimensions. Insensitive therefore aims not only to illustrate textbook spin
dynamics, but also to demonstrate the limits of different spin models.
A good argument can be made that spin should not be visualised using vectors at all, but is
best described usinng the mothods of <a href="group_theory.html">group theory</a>.
However, at least one of many vector model is being used successfully in most courses as a
first introduction to spin. Hence, Insensitive serves as much to learn about spin as it
is a tool to unlearn more limited models and concepts.
</p>

<p><b>Pulse sequences</b></p>
<p>
Insensitive can simulate a wide range of homo- and heteronuclear experiments in one and two
dimensions. The tutorial includes a list of <a href="pulse_sequences.html">pulse sequences</a>
for many NMR experiments with instructions how to set them up and understand their actions
on the spin ensemble.
</p>

<p><b>Fourier Transformation</b></p>
<p>
The <a href="pulse.html">pulsed</a> NMR experiments make use on the
<a href="fourier_transformation.html">Fourier transformation</a>, which transforms the
<a href="fid.html">free induction decay</a> recorded in the time domain into a spectrum in the
frequency domain.

<p><b>Further reading</b></p>
<p>
This tutorial is by no means a comprehensive introduction to NMR spectroscopy. The program
should be used in combination with a textbook. <i>Spin Dynamics</i> by Malcolm Levitt and
<i>Understanding NMR Spectroscopy</i> by James Keeler are highly recommened as companions
for using Insensitive. <i>Spin</i> by Ilya Kuprov gives a rigorous treatment of spin
from basic symmetries. All literature references that were used for writing Insensitive are
listed in the <a href="literature.html">bibliography</a>.
