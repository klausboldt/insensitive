The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment makes use of the magnetic moment associated
with the <a href="spin.html">spin</a> of atomic nuclei to gain information on the
<a href="pople_notation.html">chemical structure</a> of molecules and solids. Understanding
the physics behind spin dynamics can be challenging. Insensitive is an application that helps
with that by visualising the NMR experiment on the level of a spin ensemble. The spin system
is represented as a semiclassical <a href="vector_model.html">vector model</a>, as a spin
<a href="density_matrix.html">density matrix</a> and as a sum of
<a href="product_operator_formalism.html">product operators</a>. Additionally the 
<a href="energy_levels.html">energy level</a> diagram of the spin system can be displayed.

Read the <a href="manual.html">user's manual</a> for instructions to use Insensitive. The 
spectrometer hardware is explained <a href="spectrometer.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Quantum mechanics</b></p>
<p>
It is important to understand that <a href="spin.html">spin</a> is an inherently
<a href="quantum_mechanics.html">quantum mechanical</a> property that has no equivalent in
the macroscopic world. Every visualisation in three-dimensional space is bound to fail at
some point and carries the danger of misunderstanding spin. Insensitive aim is therefore
not only to illustrate textbook spin dynamics, but also to demonstrate the limits of different
spin models. A god argument can be made that spin should not at all be visualised using
the vector model. However, since it is taught and used in many textbooks and classes on NMR,
Insensitive serves as a tool understand as much as unlearn spin as literal orbital momentum.
</p>

<p><b>Pulse sequences</b></p>
<p>
Insensitive can simulate a wide range of homo- and heteronuclear experiments in one and two
dimensions. The tutorial includes a list of <a href="pulse_sequences.html">pulse sequences</a>
for many NMR experiments with instructions how to set them up and understand their actions
on the spin ensemble.
</p>

<p><b>Fourier Transformation</b></p>
<p>
The <a href="pulse.html">pulsed</a> NMR experiments make use on the
<a href="fourier_transformation.html">Fourier transformation</a>, which transforms the
<a href="fid.html">free induction decay</a> recorded in the time domain into a spectrum in the
frequency domain.

<p><b>Further reading</b></p>
<p>
This tutorial is by no means a comprehensive introduction to NMR spectroscopy. The program
should be used in combination with a textbook. <i>Spin Dynamics</i> by Malcolm Levitt and
<i>Understanding NMR Spectroscopy</i> by James Keeler are highly recommened as companions
for using Insensitive. <i>Spin</i> by Ilya Kuprov gives a rigorous treatment of spin
from basic symmetries. All literature references that were used for writing Insensitive are
listed in the <a href="literature.html">bibliography</a>.
