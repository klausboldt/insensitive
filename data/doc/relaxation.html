Relaxation
</h1>

<p>
Any spin system that is not in the equilibrium state will relax back to its Boltzmann distribution. This
happens via two mechanisms called <i>spin-lattice relaxation</i> and <i>spin-spin relaxation</i>. 
<br><br>
The spin-lattice relaxation is an enthalpic process by which the spins exchange energy with their 
surrounding medium. This can be pictured as a movement of the spins back into the direction of the 
external magnetic field <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> with the time constant <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>. It is therefore 
also called <i>longitudinal relaxation</i> or <i>T</i><sub>1</sub><i>-relaxation</i>.
</p>
<p>
The spin-spin relaxation in an entropic process and is characterised by the spins' loss of coherence. The 
off-diagonal elements of the <a href="density_matrix.html">density matrix</a> and thus all coherences are
reduced exponentially with the time constant <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>. The spin-spin relaxation is also called
<i>transverse relaxation</i> or <i>T</i><sub>2</sub><i>-relaxation</i>.

<p>
Relaxation is due to statistical fluctuations in the magnetic field that one spin 
experiences at a certain time. This can be caused by the rotational movements of molecules and 
<a href="dipolar_coupling.html">dipole-dipole couplings</a> between closely separated spins. 
If a spin is in the <i>&alpha;</i>-state at time <i>t</i>, it experiences a slightly different field at 
<i>t</i> + </i>&tau;</i>, under which the spin state takes the form of a superposition 
<i>c</i><sub>1</sub><i>&alpha;</i> + <i>c</i><sub>2</sub><i>&beta;</i>. The coefficient <i>c</i><sub>2</sub> is
the probability for the spin to change state.<br>
Statistical fluctuations are mathematically described by the autocorrelation function
</p>
<center><img src="formula_autocorrelation.png" width="196" height="19"></center>
<p>
which gives the time average of the difference between a spacial component of one spin's magnetisation 
<i>B</i><sub>x</sub> at a certain time <i>t</i> and <i>B</i><sub>x</sub> at the time <i>t</i> + 
<i>&tau;</i>. In case the random fluctuations are on a shorter time scale than <i>&tau;</i>, 
G(<i>&tau;</i>) averages to zero. The autocorrelation function is usually assumed to take a simple, 
exponential form: 
</p>
<center><img src="formula_autocorrelation_exponential.png" width="158" height="22"></center>
<p>
The constant <i>&tau;<sub>c</sub></i> is called the <i>correlation time</i>. A molecule that rotates fast 
experiences fast fluctuations and is therefore characterised by a rapidly decaying autocorrelation 
function and a short <i>&tau;<sub>c</sub></i>. A slowly rotating molecule on the other hand has a large 
correlation time and a slowly decaying autocorrelation function.
</p>
<p>
The dependance of the transition probability between two spin states is given by the spectral density 
function. Its normalised form is defined as the <a href="fourier_transformation.html">Fourier 
transform</a> of the autocorrelation function.
</p>
<center><img src="formula_spectral_density.png" width="136" height="37"></center>
<p>
Short correlation times result in a broad spectral density while long correlation times lead to a narrow 
spectral density. The transition probability between two states <i>&alpha;</i> and <i>&beta;</i> can 
then be calculated from the local magnetic field squared, the spectral density at the spin's 
<a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequency</a>, the <a href="gyromagnetic_ratio.html">gyromagnetic 
ratio</a> of the nucleus and the difference of the populations in equilibrium defined by the Boltzmann 
equation.

<p>
The very small Boltzmann factor B is important to consider when describing the individual spins, but can be 
omitted from the calculations when only the excess ensemble magnetisation is of interest.<br>
<br>
The master equation for the longitudinal relaxation returns the difference of the population vector
<b>P</b> from thermal equilibrium <b>P</b><sub>0</sub>.

<p>
For a simple, classical description the transition probability <i>W</i> = -1/<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>. For a 
more accurate treatment of relaxation one has to consider the mechanisms that induce transitions 
on a microscopic scale. In systems with spins larger than 1/2 the quadrupolar interactions often play the 
dominant role. In case of only spins 1/2 the possible mechanisms are dipole-dipole couplings, 
<a href="chemical_shift.html">chemical shift anisotropies</a> of tumbling molecules in solution and spin 
rotation. Dipole-dipole coupling is usually the most important mechanism with CSA becoming more important
at large <b>B</b><sub>0</sub>-fields.

While through-space dipolar couplings average to zero in isotropic liquids they do cause relaxation by 
allowing transitions between energy levels. The single quantum transition probability for one spin state
is the sum of all transition probabilities to every other spin with which it couples. It depends on the dipolar
coupling constant <i>b</i> and the spectral density at the spin's resonance frequency. 
</p>

<p>
The double-quantum transition causes two spins to flip between the <i>&alpha;&alpha;</i> and the 
<i>&beta;&beta;</i> state. It depends on the spectral density at the sum of both spins' 
resonance frequencies.
</p>
<center><img src="formula_W2_transition.png" width="195" height="37"></center>
<p>
The zero-quantum transition causes two spins to flip between the <i>&alpha;&beta;</i> and the 
<i>&beta;&alpha;</i> state. It depends on the spectral density at the at the difference of the two spins' 
resonance frequencies.
</p>
<center><img src="formula_W0_transition.png" width="204" height="37"></center>
<p>
Dipole-dipole couplings are not capable of inducing more than two spin flips per transition. The 
zero- and double-quantum transitions play a crucial role in the transfer of magnetisation between 
two spins known as the <a href="noe.html">nuclear Overhauser effect</a> (NOE).
</p>
<p>
For the two-spin system shown above the relaxation <a href="matrix.html">matrix</a> <b>W</b> is given 
below. For clarity, the difference between <i>W</i><sub>1</sub> probabilities for different spins are 
omitted in this equation.

<p>
The transverse relaxation must always be equal to or faster than the longitudinal relaxation. While 
<i>T</i><sub>2</sub> always decreases with increasing correlation times (i.e. larger molecules or higher 
viscosity of the solvent) <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> has a minimum for medium sized molecules in non-viscous 
solutions near room temperature.

<p>
In a two-spin system the relaxation times can be calculated from the transition probabilities. The longitudinal
relaxation time is
