            A radiofrequency <a href="pulse.html">pulse</a> changes <a href="coherences.html">coherences</a>
            in a spin system from one coherence order to another. After the first pulse, which creates
            only <a href="single_quantum_coherence.html">singe quantum coherences</a> from the state of
            thermal equilibrium, every pulse is in principle capable of <a href="coherence_transfer.html">
            transforming</a> every coherence into every other coherence possible in that spin system. The most
            convenient way to describe this is by using <a href="spherical_tensors.html">spherical tensor
            operators</a>, which directly display the coherence order.
            </p>
            <p>
            A coherence pathway is the sequence of coherence orders that the magnetisation evolves through
            during a <a href="pulse_sequences.html">pulse sequence</a>. All experiments start with zero order
            coherence (<i>z</i>-magnetisation) and should end with a coherence order of -1, which is by convention
            the one that is detected by the <a href="fid.html">quadrature detector</a>. Without
            quadrature detection the +1 coherences would be equally detectable, all higher orders are not
            correlated with observable magnetisation.
            </p>
            <p>
            For an NMR experiment it is not desirable to allow every possible coherence pathway to evolve.
            If one considers the <a href="noesyph.html">NOESY</a> and <a href="dqf_cosy.html">DQF-COSY</a>
            experiments, both have essentially the same pulse sequence of three pulses divided by delay times
            of varying length.

            The outcome of the experiment is decided by a correct selection of coherence pathways, usually
            done by <a href="phase_cycling.html">phase cycling</a>, <a href="gradients.html">pulsed field
            gradients</a>, or a combination of both.
            </p>
            <p>
            The coherence pathway is displayed like a musical score below the pulse sequence with the coherences
            being drawn as black lines that switch the order with each pulse. The diagrams are usually idealised
            and show only the relevant pathways for the experiment. Depending on the spin system, delay times
            and settings the results from the computations can vary.
            </p>
            <p>
            For a spin system with <i>n</i> spins there are 2<i>n</i>+1 possible coherences orders, negative
            and positive orders and the zero order coherence. For a pulse sequence of <i>p</i> pulses the
            maximal number of possible coherence pathways is (2<i>n</i>+1)<sup><i>p</i></sup>. This number of
            calculations needs to be performed for every phase cycle in order to get a complete description of
            the coherence pathways. While the number can be reduced by constraints like the original coherence
            order being zero, the high number of computations limits the size of pulse sequences for which a
            coherence pathway can be displayed in Insensitive.
