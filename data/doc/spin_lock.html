Spin lock

<p>
For a spin-lock a sequence of closely spaced 180&deg;-pulses is applied to a spin system. Any 
<a href="coherences.html">coherences</a> that are oriented along the axis of the pulses will be constantly
refocussed and have no chance to dephase. This effectively suppresses <a href="relaxation.html">
<i>T</i><sub>2</sub>-relaxation</a> and <a href="chemical_shift.html">chemical shifts</a>.

<p>
In a spin locked system the transverse relaxation can cause cross relaxation via 
<a href="dipolar_coupling.html">dipole-dipole coupling</a>, a mechanism that is used for 
<a href="coherence_transfer.html">coherence transfer</a> in the <a href="roesyph.html">ROESY</a> 
experiment. Also, due to being held along one axis of the <a href="rotating_frame.html">rotating frame</a>
all spin-locked spins are magnetically equivalent and strongly coupled. This is put to use in the 
<a href="mlevph.html">TOCSY</a> experiment.
</p>
<p>
An important use of spin-locking especially for <a href="solid_state_nmr.html">solid state NMR</a> methods
is cross polarisation (CP). It requires two different spins <op>I</op> and <op>S</op> to have the same 
<a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequency</a>. This so-called <i>Hartmann-Hahn condition</i> can be
achieved by adjusting the power of the different rf-channels so that the spin-lock pulses take equal time.
If this requirement is fulfilled, magnetisation will flow from <i>cold</i> to <i>hot</i> spins. Hot spins 
are those spins which are weakly oriented and have a small magnetic moment, cold spins are highly oriented
and have a large magnetic moment.
