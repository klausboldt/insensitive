A <a href="spin.html">spin</a> ensemble can be manipulated by short radio frequency pulses with phase <i>&phi;</i>
over time <i>t</i> that are applied perpendicular to the axis of the external magnetic field <b>B</b><sub>0</sub>.
The effect of these pulses is that the spin vectors rotate around an axis in the x,y-plane determined by 
<i>&phi;</i> for a flip angle <i>&beta;</i> determined by <i>t</i>, the pulse's field strength
<b>B</b><sub>1</sub>, and the <a href="gyromagnetic_ratio.html">gyromagnetic ratio</a> <i>&gamma;</i> of the spins.

A rf-pulse has a certain resonance frequency <i>&Omega;</i><sup>0</sup>, but because it is applied for a
limited period the Uncertainty Principle dictates that it also excites spins with lower and higher frequencies
than <i>&Omega;</i><sup>0</sup>. The bandwidth is determined by the pulse duration <i>t</i>, while the shape
of the pulse envelope in the time domain determines the excitation profile. In the simplest experiment
the rf-field is applied with a constant field strength, or a rectangular shape. In first approximation the
<a href="fourier_transformation.html">Fourier transformation</a> of the pulse shape determines the excitation
profile. A rectangular pulse in the frequency domain takes the shape of the sinc-function sin(<i>x</i>)/<i>x</i>.
Thus, depending on the gyromagnetic ratio of the nuclei in question it is possible to excite the whole spectrum with
one short pulse, but spins with a frequency far away from the resonance requency will experience a less effective
pulse (dashed blue line in the graph below).

<p>
In reality the excitation profile deviates from the Fourier transform of the pulse shape, with the strongest
deviations observed close to <i>&Omega;</i><sup>0</sup> (black line). These off-resonance effects are caused by
a mixture of the <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> and <b>B</b><sub>1</sub> fields acting on the spins. In the absence of the
rf-field the spins precess around the axis determined by the external magnetic field <b>B</b><sub>0</sub>.
Viewed from the <a href="rotating_frame.html">rotating frame</a> the <a href="precession.html">precession</a>
occurs with an offset frequency in the order of a few Hz,
</p>
<center><img src="formula_omega_zero.png" width="115" height="17"></center>
<p>
which corresponds to a reduced magnetic field &Delta;<b>B</b> = -&Omega;<sup>0</sup>/<i>&gamma;</i>.
If <i>&omega;</i><sup>0</sup> is equal to the reference frequency <i>&omega;</i><sup>ref</sup>
the spin appears static and the reduced magnetic field is zero.
</p>
<p>
The pulse now adds a field <b>B</b><sub>1</sub> perpendicular to <b>B</b><sub>0</sub>. The linear polarised
radiofrequency pulse can be split in two opposite, circular polarised components. The component that rotates in
the same direction and with a similar frequency as the rotating frame will have a magnitude <b>B</b><sub>1</sub>
that is comparable to &Delta;<b>B</b>, and the vectors add up to an effective field
<b>B</b>' = &Delta;<b>B</b> + <b>B</b><sub>1</sub>. The component with the opposite handedness is not in resonance
and can be neglected. If a spin's Larmor frequency matches the pulse frequency &Delta;<b>B</b> is zero and the
spins precess around the axis of <b>B</b><sub>1</sub> that lies in the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i>-plane. If the spin is
off-resonance it will precess around a rotation axis tilted from the <i>z</i>-axis by the angle
<i>&theta;<sub>p</sub></i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>&omega;</i><sub>nut</sub> is the nutation frequency with which the spin precesses in the effective field <b>B</b>'.
The effective frequency <i>&omega;</i><sub>eff</sub> that, multiplied with the pulse duration <i>t</i> determines
the flip angle <i>&beta;</i>, is larger in this case, but due to the tilted axis the pulse is less effective.

<p>
The non-linearity of the dependence of the excitation profile on the flip angle and rotation axis leads to
artefacts in the spectrum: with increasing distance from the resonance frequency the peak itensities become weaker
and the peaks acquire a phase shift that needs to be corrected. Additionally rectangular pulses introduce
oscillations of the excitation profile due to its relation to the sinc function. A number of
<a href="shaped_pulses.html">shaped pulses</a> have been devised to mitigate these problems.
</p>
<p><b>Soft pulses</b></p>
<p>
When applied as a short, <i>hard</i> pulse the bandwidth for all shapes is broad and a wide range of spins are
excited. Using a longer, low power <i>soft</i> pulse it is possible to selectively excite or saturate specific
spins in the spectrum. Gaussian and BURP pulses are effective options for this.

Another possibility to circumvent field inhomogenieties of the pulses are <a href="adiabatic_pulse.html">adiabatic
