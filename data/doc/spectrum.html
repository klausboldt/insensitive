            Once data acquisition ist started from the <a href="spin_manipulation.html">Spin State</a> panel
            or a <a href="pulse_sequence_manual.html">pulse sequence</a> with spectrum acquisition is started
            Insensitive will change to the spectrum display. This consists of three elements: the 1D or 2D graph
            of the spectrum, a list of parameters in Bruker style of the right hand side of the window,
            and five panels at the bottom that offer functions for spectrum processing. By clicking and dragging the
            mouse over the spectrum in frequency domain a cursor will appear that allows to read the exact frequency
            at the mouse position.

            <p><b>Fourier Transformation</b></p>
            <p>
            A freshly acquired pectrum will be displayed as the <a href="fid.html">free induction decay</a> in
            time domain. The panel "Fourier Transformation" offers three buttons for 1D spectra: "FID" or "SER" will
            return to the spectrum in time domain, "FFT" calculates the <a href="fourier_transformation.html">Fourier
            transformation</a> of the spectrum, and "Magnitude" will display the absolute value spectrum in
            frequency domain. If a 2D spectrum has been recorded instead of one FFT button two buttons will be
            shown that allow Fourier transformation of the <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> dimension and of both the
            <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> dimensions. A spectrum that is mirrored at the horizontal
            axis can be symmetrised along the main diagonal to only show N-type coherences by holding the Alt key and
            clicking "Symmetrise", while only P-type coherences along the antidiagonal are retained
            when holding Shift-Alt and computing the absolute value spectrum.
            </p>

            <p><b>Apodisation</b></p>
            <p>
            The FID can be modified by a choice of <a href="window_function.html">window functions</a> from a popup
            button in the "Apodisation" panel. The selected function is multiplied with the time domain data before
            Fourier transformation. The Lorentz-Gauss and pseudo-echo transformations involve
            <a href="convolution_theorem.html">deconvolution</a> of the original decay with an exponential decay with
            a decay constant taken from the <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> time in the settings. Additional options are shown
            for these functions, which allow to set an arbitrary full width at half maximum for the gauss peak as
            well as a time shift. The latter allows to show the change from gaussian apodisation (0) to a full
            pseudo-echo transformation (50 % of the length of the FID).
            </p>
            <p><b>Plot Style</b></p>
            <p>
            In the "Plot Style" panel the appearance of the spectrum can be set. By checking "Real part" and
            "Imaginary part" the simulated spectrum will display both the real (red) and imaginary (green) part of
            the signal after quadrature detection. "Integral" also displays the integrated spectrum (blue). "Grid"
            displays a grid over the spectrum graph. "Line width" sets the boldness of the graph in a 1D plot,
            while "2D Plot style" offers the choice of three display modes for 2D spectra: a contour plot, a stacked
            plot of traces that resembles a 3D projection, and a rasterised plot in which positive signals appear
            blue and negative signals appear red. Scrolling up and down with the mouse over the spectrum plot
            resized the magnitude of the spectrum.<br>
            If a 2D spectrum has been acquired using the States or TPPI method the option "Amplitude modulation"
            allows to select whether the real or imaginary data sets will be used. This will determine whether the
            diagonal or cross peaks of a spectrum will appear in pure absorption mode.
            </p>
            <p><b>Phase Correction</b></p>
            <p>
            Two sliders in the "Phase Correction" panel allow zero and first order phase correction
            (&phi;<sub>0</sub> and &phi;<sub>1</sub>) in both time and frequency domain. In the frequency domain the
            pivot point for first order phase correction can be set by changing the third slider. The arrow button
            on the right hand side resets the phase shifts and pivot point to zero.
            </p>
            <p><b>Data Analysis</b></p>
            <p>
            The "Data Analysis" panel offers specialised tools for automatic peak picking (1D), tilting of the spectrum,
            for <a href="secsyqf.html">SECSY</a> and <a href="j_resolved.html">J-resolved</a> spectra, and for
            processing of <a href="stegp1f.html">DOSY</a> spectra. The field labelled "S/N" determines
            the signal-to-noise ratio above which a peak is recognised during peak picking.
            </p>
            <p><b>Saving and exporting spectra</b></p>
            <p>
            Spectra can be opened and saved as *.igg files using the "File" menu. The displayed data can also be
            exported as universally readable files. The file type (comma separated *.csv files, tab separated
            *.dat files, JCAMP-DX *.jdx files) can be selected from the Preferences panel.
