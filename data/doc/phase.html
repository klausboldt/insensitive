Phase factor

<p>
An eigenstate <i>n</i> of a quantum mechanical system is characterised by a complex coefficient
<i>c<sub>n</sub></i> = <i>A<sub>n</sub></i> exp(<i>i&phi;<sub>n</sub></i>), which is comprised of the
amplitude <i>A<sub>n</sub></i>, which is a weighing factor for the population of the state, and a phase
<i>&phi;<sub>n</sub></i>. The phase evolves with time, but for a pure eigenstate with
<i>A<sub>n</sub></i> = 1 its value is largely inconsequential, because its value does not affect the
eigenvalue for an operator of that eigenstate.
</p>
<p>
This changes for a <a href="coherences.html">coherent</a> superposition state. "Superposition" means that
the state is composed of contributions of several states in form of a linear combination
<i>c</i><sub>1</sub><i>&Psi;</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>c</i><sub>2</sub><i>&Psi;</i><sub>2</sub> + ...
so that the sum of the amplitudes are 1. For a spin 1/2 these are the spin up (&alpha;) and spin down
(&beta;) states. "Coherent" means that there is a defined phase relationship between the contributing
states <i>&Psi;<sub>n</sub></i>. This phase difference &Delta;<i>&phi;</i> determines the orientation
of the <a href="spin.html">spin</a> vector in the <i>x</i>,<i>y</i>-plane.
</p>
<p>
A phase shift of the <a href="pulse.html">rf-pulse</a> determines which coherent superposition state is
formed, starting from a pure excess <a href="populations.html">population</a>, or which coherence is
able to interact with that pulse. In practical terms, pulse from the <i>x</i> direction (0&deg;)
will cause a rotation around the <i>x</i>-axis. A phase shift of 90&deg; will cause the spin vectors to
rotate around the <i>y</i>-axis.
</p>
<p>
If the phase of a spin is not zero (i.e., aligned along the -<i>y</i> axis following a pulse with a phase
shift of 0&deg;) at the beginning of the <a href="fid.html">FID</a>, the peaks in the spectrum will be phase
shifted. This appears as a deviation of the pure absorption Lozentzian <a href="lineshapes.html">
line shape</a> of the real spectrum and a pure dispersion line shape of the imaginary spectrum to a mixture of
absorption and dispersion line shapes. This can be corrected by multiplying the spectra with a phase 
factor. In zero order phase correction this is a constant complex number <i>&phi;</i><sub>0</sub> that 
shifts the phase of the whole spectrum, while in first order phase correction the factor 
<i>&phi;</i><sub>1</sub> depends linearly on the <a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequency</a> and 
shifts the phase of the signals relatively to each other.
