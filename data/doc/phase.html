Phase factor

<p>
In a superposition of states the coefficents <i>c<sub>n</sub></i> in the linear combination 
<i>c</i><sub>1</sub><i>&Psi;</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>c</i><sub>2</sub><i>&Psi;</i><sub>2</sub> + ... are 
generally complex numbers. They have therefore an amplitude and a phase. The amplitude is a measure
for the weighting of each wave function <i>&Psi;<sub>n</sub></i> in the linear combination, while the 
phase gives the orientation of the spin vector in the x,y-plane.
</p>
<p>
A phase shift of the <a href="pulse.html">rf-pulse</a> determines the axis around which the spin vectors 
are rotated during the pulse. A pulse from x with a phase of 0&deg; will cause a rotation around the
x-axis. A phase shift of 90&deg; will cause the spin vectors to rotate around the y-axis.
</p>
<p>
If the phase of a spin is not zero at the beginning of the <a href="fid.html">FID</a>, the signals will 
show a phase shift. This appears as a deviation of the pure absorption Lozentzian <a href="lineshapes.html">
line shape</a> of the real spectrum and a pure dispersion line shape of the imaginary spectrum to a mixture of
absorption and dispersion line shapes. This can be corrected by multiplying the spectra with a phase 
factor. In zero order phase correction this is a constant complex number <i>&phi;</i><sub>0</sub> that 
shifts the phase of the whole spectrum, while in first order phase correction the factor 
<i>&phi;</i><sub>1</sub> depends linearly on the <a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequency</a> and 
shifts the phase of the signals relatively to each other.
