        Insensitive (Incredible Nuclear Spin EvolutioN SImulation Tool Intended for Visual Education) is a
        simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on the level of a <a href="spin.html">spin</a>
        ensemble <a href="density_matrix.html">density matrix</a>. Every step in the simulation can be controlled,
        a fact that is highly instructive, but can on occasion require less efficient algorithms than simulations
        aimed at realistic spectra of complete molecules. A complete simulation usually consists of four distinct
        steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Set up a <a href="spineditor.html">spin system</a></li>
            <li>Manipulate the <a href="spin_manipulation.html">spin state</a></li>
            <li>Record and run a <a href="pulse_sequence_manual.html">pulse sequence</a></li>
            <li>Acquire and process a <a href="spectrum.html">spectrum</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        Each of these steps is handled in a dedicated panel in the main window of the application. Each panel can
        be accessed via a button in the toolbar of the main window.
        </p>
        <center><img src="img_toolbar.png" style="width:100%; max-width:640px;"></center>
        <p>
        The toolbar consists of 8 buttons. The first four (Spin System, Spin State, Pulse Sequence, Spectrum)
        access the main steps of the simulation. Four more buttons access additional windows that control advanced
        functions in Insensitive: the <a href="spin_manipulation.html">Matrix Composer</a> to directly manipulate
        the density matrix, the <a href="settings.html">Pulse Shape</a> module to view and edit the
        <a href="shaped_pulses.html">pulse shape</a> and excitation profiles, the <a href="single_spins.html">Single
        Spins</a> module to help visualise the translation between the behaviour of single spins and the ensemble
        magnetisation described by the density matrix, and finally this Tutorial help file.
        <!-->The <a href="presentation.html"> Presentation Editor</a> that allows to build simple full screen
        presentations including all available models and animations is currently not implemented.</-->
        </p>
        <p><b>Command Line Shortcuts</b></p>
        <p>
        In addition to the graphical user interface Insensitive offers a <a href="commandline.html">command line</a>
        at the bottom of the main window. It allows to apply product operators directly to the spin state. In
        addition, Insensitive unerstands many commands from Bruker NMR applications (XWin-NMR, TopSpin) and a number
        of proprietary commands to access basic functions of the application.

        Some aspects of NMR cannot be simulated by Insensitive due to the way the program is written. These
        <a href="limitations.html">limitations</a> include chemical shift aniostropies and recovery of
        magnetisation lost to field inhomogeneities after a refocussing pulse.<br>

        The author has no professional relationship with the Bruker company. The use of Bruker-style formats
        (command line, pulse programs, parameter list) is a result of his familiarity with these programs and the
        wide-spread use of this equipment in all institutes in which he has worked.
