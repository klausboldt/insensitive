The dipolar longitudinal <a href="relaxation.html">cross-relaxation</a> and therefore also the 
<a href="noe.html">NOE</a> efficiency plotted against the correlation time undergoes a zero crossing. 
Thus, cross peaks in a <a href="noesyph.html">NOESY</a> spectrum will have a different sign for small and 
large molecules and may disappear altogether for medium sized molecules. This can be circumvented by 
using the Rotating frame Overhauser Effect (ROE) instead. If a <a href="spin_lock.html">spin locking</a> 
field is applied to the spin system the spins are static in the <a href="rotating_frame.html">rotating 
frame</a> and transversal cross relaxation can happen. This is put to use in the ROESY or CAMELSPIN 
experiment. (The latter acronym stands for Cross relaxation Appropriate for Mini-molecules EmuLated by 
SPIN-locking.)

<p>
The ROESY <a href="pulse_sequences.html">pulse sequence</a> is basically the same as the 
<a href="mlevph.html">TOCSY</a> experiment, and effects from TOCSY will appear in the ROESY spectrum and 
vice versa. To minimise the <a href="coherence_transfer.html">coherence transfer</a> through 
<i>J</i>-couplings the ROESY uses spin-locking pulses with less power. These are slightly off-resonance 
and reduce the magnetic equivalence and strong coupling effects of the TOCSY.
</p>
<p>
The ROESY pulse sequence is analogous to the NOESY sequence, but instead of the second pulse that converts
the transversal magnetisation back to longitudinal magnetisation, followed by the mixing time <i>&tau;</i>
and a third pulse that creates observable transversal magnetisation again, a spin-locking field is used. 
This allows for cross relaxation directly in the transversal plane, which is detected after the spin-lock 
is switched off. ROESY cross peaks are always negative.
