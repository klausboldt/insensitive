            In order to go through all effects that can occur in a <a href="two_dimensional_spectra.html">
            2D spectrum</a>, start with a homonuclear system of three spins. Set the 
            <a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequencies</a> to <i>&Omega;</i><sub>1</sub> = 3.2 Hz, 
            <i>&Omega;</i><sub>2</sub> = -2.7 Hz and <i>&Omega;</i><sub>3</sub> = 0.3 Hz. Create a spin 
            system with a linear topology by setting the <a href="coupling.html">coupling</a> constants 
            to <i>J</i><sub>12</sub> = 0.25 Hz and <i>J</i><sub>23</sub> = 0.37 Hz. Spins 1 and 3 should
            not couple. These settings make use of the whole spectral width if the dwell time is set to 0.1 s.
            In Insensitive for Mac OS X this spin system is supplied in the <typewriter>Examples</typewriter> 
            folder as <typewriter>3 Spins (AMX).iss</typewriter>.

            The simplest 2D spectrum is the <a href="cosyqf.html">COSY</a> spectrum, which shows the 
            original spectrum along the diagonal and cross peaks between all spins that couple directly.
            The experiment consists of two 90&deg; pulses, separated by a delay time <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, 
            followed by the spectrum acquisition.

            <p>
            Open the Pulse Sequence window, press "Record" and apply in that order a 
            90&deg;<sub>x</sub> pulse, a free evolution with a delay time of 1 s and another 
            90&deg;<sub>x</sub> pulse. Finish the recording by pressing "Acquire" to obtain a 1D spectrum
            with the independent time variable <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>. Recording of the pulse sequence will 
            stop automatically. The resulting 1D spectrum shows a distorted mixture of in-phase and 
            <a href="antiphase_magnetization.html">antiphase</a> peaks.

            In order to acquire a 2D spectrum, another time variable needs to be introduced. This is the 
            variable delay time <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, which can be chosen from the pull down menu in the 
            Pulse Sequence window as the only option. Selecting it marks the evolution time in blue. When 
            clicking on "2D Spectrum" the acquisition starts. When all data points are recorded, the 
            two dimensional <a href="fid.html">FID</a> (called SER for "serial FID") is displayed in the 
            Spectrum window. Clicking on "FFT (t<sub>2</sub>)" <a href="fourier_transformation.html">
            Fourier transforms</a> every row of the spectrum, leading to an array of spectra
            with different <a href="phase.html">phases</a>. The fully transformed 2D spectrum can be 
            obtained by pressing "FFT (t<sub>1</sub> + t<sub>2</sub>)". The resulting spectrum shows a
            square array of peaks with the original 1D spectrum overlaid in the middle. This artefact is
            caused by spin <a href="relaxation.html">relaxation</a> back to <i>z</i>-magnetisation during
            <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, which is turned into transverse magnetisation by the second pulse.

            It can be easily removed by recording the spectrum a second time, but with the phase of the 
            first pulse and the receiver shifted by 180&deg;. In this procedure, called 
            <a href="phase_cycling.html">phase cycling</a>, the two spectra are added together. The 
            artefacts in both spectra have opposing phases and are cancelled out, while the rest of the 
            spectrum adds up. Change the number of phase cycles to 2 and enter "180" as the phase 
            in the second row of the table for "Phase 1" and "Receiver", then retake the spectrum.
            </p>

            <p>
            It becomes obvious now that the spectrum is mirrored at the horizontal axis in the centre of 
            the spectrum. This is caused by the fact that while the receiver can differentiate between 
            clockwise and anticlockwise <a href="precession.html">precession</a> by taking complex value
            FIDs (recording both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values), the method is blind for this when 
            varying <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>. Every frequency will feature as both positive and negative 
            values. One can try to get rid of it by symmetrisation, where the absolute value spectrum is 
            mirrored at one of the diagonal axes and only the larger value is used at both side of the 
            diagonal. This still leaves artefacts, so two additional phase cycles are used to remove one 
            of the mirror images. Raise the number of phase cycles to 4 and enter the values "90" and "270"
            for "Phase 1" and "270" and "90" for "Receiver", respectively. After 2D Fourier transformation 
            the spectrum should resemble a COSY spectrum with the diagonal from the top right to the 
            bottom left.

            <p>
            This is called an N-type spectrum, because only negative <a href="coherences.html">coherences</a>
            contribute to the signal. The P-type spectrum, which is mirrored along the other diagonal, can 
            be obtained by changing the last phase cycles to "90" and "270" for "Phase 1" and "90" and 
            "270" for "Receiver".
            </p>
            <p>
            Another problem arises from the fact that the spectrum cannot be phase corrected along the 
            indirect <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> axis. In the phase modulated way the spectra have been acquired 
            so far, the peaks have a phase-twist <a href="lineshapes.html">line shape</a>, a mix of pure
            absorption and dispersion line shape, which broadens all peaks. This can be circumvented by
            acquiring an <a href="pure_phase_spectra.html">amplitude modulated</a> spectrum. There are several
            ways to achieve this; the States method employed here requires two sets of spectra, the second having
            the phases of all pulses before <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> shifted by 90&deg;. The real components
            of these spectra are either purely composed of cosine or sine waves and are combined as real 
            and imaginary parts in a new data set, which is Fourier transformed to yield a spectrum with 
            peaks in pure absorption or dispersion mode. To use the States method select "States" from the 
            "Detection" pull down menu in the Pulse Sequence window. This method already accounts for the 
            selection of either N- or P-type coherences, and only the first two phase cycles are needed for
            each of the datasets. The final <a href="pulse_sequences.html">pulse sequence</a> can be found 
            in the <typewriter>Examples</typewriter> folder of Insensitive for Max OS X as 
            <typewriter>COSY.ipp</typewriter>.

            <p>
            As can be seen from this procedure, the removal of every artefact requires the number of 
            datasets to be doubled, decreasing the overall sensitivity of the method. Even with these 
            measures in place the diagonal peaks in a COSY spectrum have a 90&deg; phase shift in 
            relation to the cross peaks, and one of them will have broad dispersion line shapes. The 
            <a href="dqf_cosy.html">DQF-COSY</a> experiment was devised to yield a 2D correlation spectrum
            with all peaks in absorption mode.

            This tutorial only applies for Insensitive for Mac OS X. Unfortunately, the calculations are 
            too demanding of the processing power of iOS devices.
