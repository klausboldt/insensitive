In a magnetic field the possible energy eigenstates of a <a href="spin.html">spin</a> 1/2 split up into 
to energy levels, called Zeeman splitting. The levels are denominated <i>&alpha;</i> for the lower state 
and <i>&beta;</i> for the higher state. In a system of more than one spin each energy level corresponds 
to one configuration of each spin in the system, e.g. <i>&alpha;&beta;&alpha;</i> in a system of three 
spins.<br>
In the very simple energy level description of NMR peaks in the spectrum are treated as transitions 
between states. The energy levels of a spin system reveal the relative positions of the eigenstates on 
an energy scale, the Zeeman splitting and transition energies. This model treats peaks in the spectrum as 
transitions between states. A transition between two levels where only one spin is changed corresponds to 
an observable, <a href="single_quantum_coherence.html">Single-quantum transition</a>. The energy level 
diagrams do not account for <a href="coherences.html">coherences</a>, superposition states and phenomena 
such as <a href="coherence_transfer.html">coherence transfer</a>.
</p>
<p>
For a <a href="coupling.html">weakly coupled</a> spin system of two spins the energy diagram can be constructed by first 
drawing the splitting of one spin into the levels <i>&alpha;</i> and <i>&beta;</i> and then splitting these 
levels according to the second spin's <a href="larmor_frequency.html">resonance frequency</a>. This yields 
four energy levels with four observable transitions, each two with the same energy difference.

<p>
The coupling interaction increases or decreases the energy values and creates the typical doublet that 
splits symmetrically around the spins' resonance energies.
</p>
<p>
If two spins are magnetically equivalent, the splitting leads to two degenerate eigenstates. In this case 
the states <i>&alpha;&beta;</i> and <i>&beta;&alpha;</i> mix. The system is best described in the 
<a href="singlet_triplet_basis.html">singlet-triplet basis</a>, for which the Hamiltonian matrix takes diagonal
form. The system comprises of three energy levels forming a triplet state

<p>
and one level forming a singlet state.
</p>
<center><img src="formula_singlet.png" height="42" width="212"></center>
<p>
The transition between triplet and singlet states is spin forbidden, which leads to the disappearance of 
two transitions in the spectrum. The doublet of each coupling partner collapses to a single line.

<p>
In the case of strong coupling the mixing between the <i>&alpha;&beta;</i> and <i>&beta;&alpha;</i> states 
is incomplete with the degree of mixing described by the angle <i>&xi;</i>.
</p>

<p>
The energy levels can no longer be assigned to well defined states of each spin, since the two spins are
indistinguishable. Intead, both antiparallel states of the Zeeman basis contribute to each energy level.
</p>
<center><img src="formula_mixed_states.png" height="38" width="232"></center>
<p>
This results in two transitions being less probable in comparison to the other two. In the spectrum one observes
the 'roofing' effect of strongly coupled doublets, where the peaks that are further apart in a pair of coupled
spins appear weaker than the peaks that are closer in energy.

<p>
The spectral lines in a strongly coupled doublet are no longer symmetrically arranged around the resonance energy.
The shift of the partially mixed energy levels is given by the strong coupling parameter.

The transition probability <i>P</i> between two states <i>&psi;</i> and <i>&phi;</i> is the absolute square
of the off-diagonal matrix element of the <op>Ix</op> operator for the transition between both states.

The limits for large and small <i>&xi;</i> are the cases of weak coupling and magnetically equivalent spins,
respectively.
