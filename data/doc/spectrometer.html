<p>
The NMR spectrometer consists of a large, superconducting magnet, which is immersed in liquid helium.
The helium tank is located inside a bath of liquid nitrogen to prevent the helium from evaporating. The 
superconducting coils of modern NMR magnets are made of (NbTaTi)<sub>3</sub>Sn wires surrounded by a layer of 
Cu. The current is injected into the magnet once when the spectrometer is set up and then runs continuously 
without losses as long as the coil is cooled to 4.2 K.<br>
Inside the long, centre bore the magnetic field is homogeneous with a field strength of 11.7 T for a 500 MHz 
spectrometer. Smaller shim coils inside the bore are used to correct field inhomogenieties.
</p>
<p>
The probe head, which contains the rf- and receiver coils, is inserted from the bottom into the homogeneous 
region of the magnetic field. Additionally, the probe head includes a preamplifier and optionally a sample 
spinner, temperature regulation and coils for <a href="gradients.html">gradient fields</a>. The sample is 
inserted into the centre bore and resides inside the probe head during the measurement.

In order to perform high resolution NMR the signal must be locked to a frequency in order to correct small 
shifts of the magnetic field during the acquisition of the <a href="fid.html">FID</a>. This is usually done by 
constantly measuring the deuterium signal of the solvent, which does not interfere with the actual spectrum.
</p>
<p>
<a href="pulse.html">rf-Pulses</a> and signal detection is performed with the same coil. The unit that 
directs the strong pulses to the coil and the weak signals from the coils to the detector unit is called the 
duplexer. The direction from which the pulse is transmitted is controlled by <a href="phase.html">phase 
shifting</a> the pulse frequency.
</p>
<p>
The acquired signal must then be converted into a digital signal with the analogue/digital-converter (ADC). 
The electronics of current ADCs is not able to convert the high frequencies of the raw signal. The quadrature 
receiver therefore combines the signal with an electronically created reference frequency. Effectively, this 
is a transformation from the laboratory frame to the <a href="rotating_frame.html">rotating frame</a>.

<p>
In order to distinguish between frequencies of the same absolute value but different sign relative to the 
reference frequency the quadrature detection results in a sine and a cosine signal, which can be interpreted 
as the real and imaginary part of a complex signal. The cosine part can be seen as the signal's projection onto
the <i>y</i>-axis, while the sine part is the <i>x</i>-component of the signal. Between <i>x</i>- and 
<i>y</i>-component exists a phase shift of 90&deg;.

The pre-amplified, complex signal is sent to the NMR console, where the information is processed into the 
FID and recorded on a workstation.
