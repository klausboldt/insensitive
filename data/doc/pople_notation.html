            The Pople notation is a way of describing <a href="spin.html">spin</a> systems and
            <a href="coupling.html">coupling</a> patterns with a simple letter code. It is named after its
            inventor John Pople and is used to distinguish strongly and weakly coupled systems, and
            <a href="energy_levels.html">magnetically equivalent</a> spins. For weakly coupled spins the
            <a href="chemical_shift.html">chemical shift</a> difference is much larger than the coupling constant,
            while the two are of the same size for strongly coupled spins. The spins are expressed as letters, whose
            distance in the latin alphabet symbolised the relative chemical shift. The letters used tend to be
            limited to A, B, N, M, X, Y.

            Strongly coupled systems can lead to complex peak patterns that cannot be analysed manually, but
            require help by computer simulation. These systems, in which &Delta;&nu;/<i>J</i> (all in Hz) is smaller
            than 5, are called second order spectra. A larger <a href="spectrometer.html">spectrometer</a>
            frequency will increase the separation between peaks and thereby simplify the spectrum.

            It is important to note the difference between chemical and magnetical equivalence: chemical equivalence
            is observed if two or more spins have the same chemical shift, or, in other words, if the spins can
            change place by a symmetry operation of the molecule. To be magnetically equivalent they must also have
            the same <i>J</i> coupling to all coupled spins in the system.<br>
            In 1,1-difluoroethylene each proton has different coupling constants to the fluorine in <i>cis</i> and
            <i>trans</i> position. Swapping the protons will also change the coupling to each fluorine nucleus.
            This leads to a AA'XX' pattern. In 1,1-difluoroallene the coupling constants to both fluorine nuclei is
            the same, the proton (and fluorine) spins are magnetically equivalent, and the signals appear as a
            A<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> pattern.
