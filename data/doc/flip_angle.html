Flip angle
</h1>
</div>

<div>
<p>
The flip angle <i>&beta;</i> is the angle around which a spin vector is flipped when irradiated with an 
<a href="pulse.html">rf-pulse</a>. The angle can be determined by tuning the power and duration of the 
pulse.
</p>
<p>
In routine experiments a flip angle is selected so that the optimum between <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> relaxation
times and the recording time is achieved for the best signal-to-noise ratio. A large angle of 90&deg; 
will yield high signal intensity but needs long relaxation times. A smaller angle allows for higher 
repetition rates on the cost of sensitivity. The optimum value for <i>&beta;</i> is called the 
<i>Ernst angle</i>.

A typical value is 30&deg; for the <a href="zg.html">1D-experiment</a> (Bruker code: zg30).
