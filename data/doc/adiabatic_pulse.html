<p>
An important concept in <a href="quantum_mechanics.html">quantum mechanics</a> is the adiabatic theorem: If 
a system is subjected to a slow and gradual change the wave function can adept to the changing conditions. At 
the end of the perturbation the system is in an eigenstate of the final Hamiltonian that corresponds to the 
initial eigenstate it started with.<br>
A rapid change of the Hamiltonian, as it is the case with the strong <a href="pulse.html">rf-pulses</a> in NMR,
does not allow the system to adapt to the changed conditions. The result is a linear combination of states that
reproduces the probability density of the initial state.

Adiabatic pulses perform the gradual change of the spin system by modulating the amplitude and frequency or 
<a href="phase.html">phase</a> of the <b>B</b><sub>1</sub>-field during the pulse. Additionally to 
<b>B</b><sub>1</sub> a magnetisation component along the <i>z</i>-axis affect the <a href="spin.html">
spins</a>, which depends on the offset &Delta;<i>&omega;</i> of the pulse frequency to the reference frequency 
of the <a href="rotating_frame.html">rotating frame</a>. The effective magnetic field at a specific time 
<i>t</i> is

where <i>&gamma;</i> is the <a href="gyromagnetic_ratio.html">gyromagnetic ratio</a> and 
<b>e</b><sub><i>z</i></sub> the unit vector along the <i>z</i>-axis. This causes the spins to move on a 
complicated trajectory, depending on their <a href="larmor_frequency.html">Larmor frequency</a>. Still, 
different spins end up with the same magnetisation after the pulse. The advantage of adiabatic pulses over 
rectangular pulses is their insensitivity to losses in pulse quality due to inhomogenic 
<b>B</b><sub>1</sub>-fields.
