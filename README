INSENSITIVE
===========

Insensitive (Incredible Nuclear Spin EvolutioN SImulation Tool Intended for
Visual Education) is a simulation of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
experiment for educational purposes. It allows to interact with every step
from spin precession to Fourier transformation and processing of acquired 1D
and 2D spectra. A paper on an earlier verion of Insensitive has been published
in Concepts of Magnetic Resonance, 2011, 38A (2), 17-24.
(DOI:10.1002/cmr.a.20203)

Until version 0.9.33 Insensitive was written in Objective-C and based on
Apple's Cocoa framework. For version 0.9.34 it has been ported to C with GLib
and GTK3 for better portability. The new version is compatible with the old
file formats for spin systems, pulse programs, and spectra.


Installation
============

The program supports both the Meson Build system and GNU Autotools. It can be
compiled and installed with the following commands:

	meson build
	ninja -C build/
	ninja -C build/ install

or, alternatively:

	./configure
	make
	make install

If WebKit2GTK is not available (a likely scenario on Windows and macOS systems)
use "./configure --disable-webkit" to compile without native support for
displaying html data. A request will then instead be sent to the standard web
browser to show the tutorial pages.


Dependencies
============

- BLAS/LAPACK
- FFTW3
- GLib 2.0
- Gio >= 2.50
- GTK+ >= 3.22
- Cairo
- WebKit2GTK 4.0
- libxml 2.0

On Ubuntu-based systems, install the dependencies with

	sudo apt install libblas-dev liblapack-dev libfftw3-dev libxml2-dev \
		         libglib2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev

On Fedora-based systems, install the dependencies with

	yum install blas-devel lapack-devel fftw3-devel libxml2-devel \
	            glib2-devel gtk3-devel webkit2gtk3-devel


Support
=======

Insensitive includes a tutorial and user manual, written in HTML, that can be
accessed from the graphical user interface. It includes practical examples and
discusses the limitations of the simulation. Example files for useful spin
systems, common pulse programs, and 1D and 2D spectra can be found in the
examples/ directory of the distribution.

Insensitive 0.9.13 made changes to the *.iss file format. Insensitive 0.9.24
made changes to the *.ipp file format. Insensitive 0.9.22 made changes to the
*.igg file format. Insensitive is fully backwards compatible, but files created
with a newer version of the program cannot be opened with older (macOS)
versions of Insensitive.

For any further question on the usage of Insensitive, or to report bugs or
make suggestions, please contact Klaus Boldt <klaus.boldt@uni-rostock.de>.


Third Party Software
