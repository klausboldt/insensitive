  from launching

Version 0.9.30 includes the following new features and fixes:

- Fixes for some critical bugs that have appeared in newer versions of macOS
- Added several new heteronuclei

Version 0.9.29 includes the following new features and fixes:

- Step-wise execution of pulse sequences (hold ALT and run the pulse sequence
  to start with the first step. The "Play" icon changes to a foot step symbol.)
- More options editing pulse sequences
- Traficante window function

Version 0.9.27 includes the following new features and fixes:

- The interface has been redesigned using less separate windows. The user
  now experiences a clearer work flow of creating a spin system, manipulating
  the spin state, applying a pulse sequence, and processing the spectrum.
- Fixed a number of crucial bugs mainly concerning the correct execution of
  pulse sequences and gradients
- Insensitive now saves the current pulse sequence when closing the
  application and restores it the next time
- New tutorial page on shaped pulses and rewritten user manual

Version 0.9.26 includes the following new features and fixes:

- Reworked pulse shape display that shows the correct excitation profiles
- Proper behaviour for DANTE pulse trains
- BURP pulses now automatically set the pulse angle they were designed for
- Added some more toolbar buttons for the tutorial window
- Bugfixes

Version 0.9.25 includes the following new features and fixes:

- Command line for Bruker-style commands (XWin-NMR, TopSpin) and direct
  application of product operators
- Bugfixes

Version 0.9.24 includes the following new features and fixes:

- Full support for soft pulses with off-resonance effects
- Pulse duration, strength, and frequency settings
- Selection of shaped pulses, including Gauss, Sinc, BURP, and DANTE
- Spin vector traces during pulses and evolution (grapefruit diagrams)
- Individual active spin selection is no longer used in pulse sequences
- I and S spins can no longer be detected simultaneuously
- Pulse Shaper window no longer controls pulse excitation profile
- Old pulse behaviour can be enabled in application preferences
- updates to *.ipp and *.spinlecture file formats (backwards compatible)

Version 0.9.23 includes JCAMP-DX export for 1D spectra.

Version 0.9.22 includes the following new features and fixes:

- States-TPPI detection
- A new spectrum window with cleaner controls, scale bars, and grid

- A presentation editor that can create life slides for use in talks
  and lectures
- Save and open spectra
