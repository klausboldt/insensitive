Roadmap for Insensitive (GTK)
=============================

Missing features not yet ported from the OSX version:
-----------------------------------------------------
- The application should look for available updates
- Play sound when acquisition is finished

Known bugs:
-----------
- Combine overlapping Energy level labels
- Sometimes phase cycling table has NaNs at the end
- Coherence transfer is not updated when spin type is changed
- Checkboxes are not set correctly on startup (pulseArray, relaxation, show real/imag/integral)
- Symmetrisation of amplitude-modulated 2D spectra fails (TPPI, States-TPPI)

Roadmap to version 1.0:
-----------------------
- Phase correction should be possible in F1 for 2D spectra
- Re-implement Presentation Mode (standard view as one of many presentations?)
- Adiabatic pulses

Roadmap beyond version 1.0:
---------------------------
- Implement spins > 1/2
- Irreducible spherical tensor operators (SpinDrops)
