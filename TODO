Roadmap for Insensitive (GTK)
=============================

Missing features not yet ported from the OSX version:
-----------------------------------------------------
- Energy level labels need to wrap if they are too long (use pango)
- Phase correction should be possible in F1 for 2D spectra
- The application should look for available updates

Known bugs:
-----------
- A lot of memory leaks (valgrind --leak-check=full)
- Coherence transfer is not updated when spin type is changed
- Checkboxes are not set correctly on startup (pulseArray, relaxation, show real/imag/integral)

Roadmap to version 1.0:
-----------------------
- Running versions for Windows (MSYS2), macOS (jhbuild)

Roadmap beyond version 1.0:
---------------------------
- Re-implement Presentation Mode (standard view as one of many presentations?)
- Implement spins > 1/2
- Irreducible spherical tensor operators (SpinDrops)
